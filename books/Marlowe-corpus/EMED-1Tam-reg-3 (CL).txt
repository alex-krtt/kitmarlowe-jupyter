 Tamburlaine the Great. Who, from a Scythian Shepherd, by his rare and wonderful Conquests, became a most puissant and mighty Monarch. And (for his tyranny, and terror in War) wastermed, The Scourge of God. Divided into two Tragical Discourses, as they were sundry times showed upon Stages in the City of London. By the right honorable the Lord Admiral, his servants. Now first, and newly published. LONDON. Printed by Richard Jones:at the sign of the Rose and Crown near Holborn Bridge. 1590. To the Gentlemen Readers: and others that take pleasure in reading Histories. Gentlemen, and courteous Readers whosoever: I have here published in print for your sakes, the two tragical Discourses of the Scythian Shepherd, Tamburlaine, that became so great a Conqueror, and so mighty a Monarch: My hope is, that they will be now no less acceptable unto you to read after your serious affairs and studies, than they have been  (lately) delightful for many of you to see, when  the same wereshowed in London upon stages:  I have (purposely) omitted and left out some   fond and frivolous Gestures, digressing (and in  my poor opinion) far unmeet for the matter,which I thought, might seemmore tedious unto the wise, than any way else to be regarded, though (happily) they have beenof some vain conceited fondlings greatly gaped at, what times they were showed upon the stage in their graced deformities: nevertheless now, to be mixtured in print with such matter ofworth, it would prove a greatdisgrace to so honorable and stately a history: Great follywere it in me, to commendunto your wisdoms, either the eloquence of the Author that writ them, or the worthiness of the matter itself; I therefore leave unto your learned censures, both the one and the other, and myself the poor printer of them untoyour most courteous and favorable protection; which if you vouchsafe to accept, you shall evermore bind me to employ what travail and service I can, to the advancing and pleasuring of your excellent degree. Yours, most humble at commandment, R. J. Printer The two tragical Discourses of mighty Tamburlaine, the Scythian Shepherd. etc. The Prologue. FRom jigging veins of rhyming mother wits,And such conceits as clownage keeps in pay, We�ll lead you to the stately tent of War. Where you shall hear the Scythian Tamburlaine: Threat�ning the world with high astounding terms And scourging kingdoms with his conquering swordView but his picture in this tragic glass, And then applaud his fortunes as you please. Actus. 1. Scaena. 1. Mycetes, Cosroe, Meander, Theridamas, Ortygius,Ceneus, with othersBRother Cosroe, I findmyself aggrieved,Yet insufficient to express the same: For it requires a great and thund�ring speech: Good brother tell the cause unto my Lords, I know you have a better wit than I. Unhappy Persia, that in former ageHast been the seat of mighty Conquerors, That in their prowess and their policies, Have triumphed over Afric, and the bounds Of Europe, where the Sun dares scarce appear, For freezing meteors and congealed cold: Now to be ruled and governed by a man, At whose birthday Cynthia with Saturn joined, And Jove, the Sun and mercury denied To shed his influence in his fickle brain,Now Turks and Tartars shake their swords at thee Meaning to mangle all thy Provinces,Brother, I see your meaning well enough. And through your Planets I perceive you think, I am not wise enough to be a king,But I refer me to my noble men,That know my wit, and can be witnesses: I might command you to be slain for this, Meander, might I not? Not for so small a fault my sovereign Lord Mycetes I mean it not, but yet I know I might, Yet live, yea, live, Mycetes wills it so: thou my faithful Counselor, Declare the cause of my conceived grief, Which is (God knows) about that Tamburlaine. That like a Fox in midst of harvest time, Doth pray upon my flocks of Passengers. And as I hear, doth mean to pull my plumes, Therefore �tis good and meet for to be wise. Oft have I heard your Majesty complain, Of Tamburlaine, that sturdy Scythian thief, That robs your merchants of Persepolis, Treading by land unto the Western Isles, And in your confines with his lawless train, Daily commits incivil outrages. Hoping (misled by dreaming prophecies) To reign in Asia, and with barbarous Armies, To make himself the Monarch of the East:But erehe march in Asia, or display His vagrant Ensign in the Persian fields,Your Grace hath taken order by Theridamas,          Charged with a thousand horse, to apprehend And bring him Captive to your Highness throne, Full true thou speakst, and like thyselfmy lord Whom I may term a Damon for thy love. Therefore �tis best, if so it like you all, To send my thousandhorse incontinent, To apprehend that paltry Scythian. How like you this, my honorable Lords? Is it not a kingly resolution? It cannotchoose, because it comes from you. Then hear thy charge, valiant Theridamas The chiefest Captain of Mycetes� host, The hope of Persia, and the very legs Whereon our state doth lean, as on a staff, That holds us up, and foils our neighbor foes, Thou shalt be leader of this thousand horse, Whose foaming gall with rage and high disdain, Have sworn the death of wicked Tamburlaine. Go frowning forth, but come thou smiling home,As did Sir Paris with the Grecian Dame, Return withspeed, time passeth swift away, Our lifeis frail, and we may die today. Before the Moon renew her borrowed light, Doubt not my Lord and gracious Sovereign, But Tamburlaine, and that Tartarian rout, Shall either perish by our warlike hands, Or plead for mercy at your highness� feet. Go, stout Theridamas, thy words are swords And with thy looks thou conquerest all thy foes: I long to see thee back return from thence, That I may view these milk�white steeds of mine.All ladenwith the heads of killed men, And from their knees, even to their hooves below, Be smeared with blood, that makes a dainty show. Then now my Lord, I humbly take my leave. ExitTheridamas farewell ten thousand times, Ah, Menaphon, why stayest thou thus behind, When othermen press forward for renown: Go Menaphon, go into Scythia,And foot by foot follow Theridamas: Nay, pray you let him stay, a greater Fits Menaphon, than warring with a Thief: Create him Prorex of Africa, Thathe may win the Babylonians� hearts, Which willrevolt from Persian government, Unless they have a wiser kingthan you.   Unless they have a wiser kingthan you? These are his words, Meander set them down. And add this to them, that all Asia Lament to see the folly of their King. Well here I swear by this my royal seat.You may do well to kiss it then. Embossed with silk as best beseems my state. To be revenged for these contemptuous words. O where is duty and allegiance now? Fled to the Caspian or the Ocean main? What, shall I call thee brother? No, a foe, Monster of Nature, shame unto thy stock, That dar�st presume thy Sovereign for tomock. Meander come, I amabused Meander. Exit Manent Cosroe and MenaphonHow now my Lord, what, mated and amazed To hear the king thus threaten like himself? Ah Menaphon, I pass not for his threats, The plot is laid by Persian Noble men, And Captains of the Medean garrisons, To crown me Emperor of Asia, But this it is that dothexcruciate The very substance of my vexed soul: To see our neighbors that werewont to quake And tremble at the Persian monarch�s name, Now sits and laughs our regiment to scorn, And that which might resolve me into tears:Men from the farthest equinoctial line, Have swarmed in troops into theEastern India: Lading their ships with gold and precious stones: And made their spoils from all our provinces. This should entreat your highness to rejoice, Since Fortune gives you opportunity, To gainthe title of a Conqueror, By curing of this maimedEmpire, Afric and Europe bordering on your land, And continent to your Dominions: How easily may you with a mighty host, Pass into Graecia, as did Cyrus once. And cause them to withdraw their forces home, lest you subdue the pride of Christendom.? But Menaphon what means this trumpet�s sound Behold, my Lord Ortygius, and the rest, Bringing the Crown to make you Emperor. Enter Ortigius and Conerus bearing a Crownwith others.Magnificent and mighty Prince Cosroe,We in the name of other Persian states, And commons of this mighty Monarchy, Present thee with th� Imperial Diadem. The warlike Soldiers, and theGentlemen, That heretofore have filled Persepolis With Afric Captains, takenin the field: Whose ransom madethem march in coats of gold, With costly jewels hanging at their ears, And shining stones upon their lofty Crests, Now living idle in the walled towns, Wanting both pay and martial discipline. Begin introops to threaten civil war.And openlyexclaim against the King. Therefore to stay all sudden mutinies, We will invest your Highness Emperor: Whereat the Soldiers will conceivemorejoy, Then did the Macedonians at the spoil Of great Darius and his wealthy host. Well, since I see the state of Persia droop, And languish inmy brother�s government: I willingly receive th� imperial crown, And vow to wear it for my country�s good: In spite of them shall malice my estate. And in assurance of desired success, We here do crown thee Monarch of the East, Emperor of Asia, and of Persia, Great Lord of Medea and Armenia: Duke of Africa and Albania, Mesopotamia and of Parthia, East India and the late discovered Isles, Chief Lord of all the wide vast Euxine sea, And of the ever raging Caspian Lake: Long live Cosroe mighty Emperor. And Jove may never letme longer live, Than I may seek to gratify your love, And cause the soldiers that thus honor me, To triumph over many Provinces. By whose desires of disciplineinArms, I doubt not shortly but to reign sole king, And with theArmy of Theridamas, Whether we presently will fly (my Lords) To rest secure against my brother�s force. We knew my Lord, before we brought the crown, Intending your investion so near, The residence of your despised brother, The Lord would not be too exasperate, To injure or suppress your worthy title. Or if they would, there are in readiness Ten thousandhorse to carry you from hence, In spite of all suspected enemies. I know it well my Lord, and thank you all. Sound up the trumpets then, God save the King.ExuntActus. 1. Scaena. 2: Tamburlaine leading Zenocrate: Techelles, Usumcasane,other Lords and Soldiers ladenwith treasure.Tamburlaine COme lady, let not this appallyour thoughts The jewels and thetreasure we have ta�en Shall be reserved, and you in better state, Than if you were arrived in Syria. even in thecircle of your Father�s armies: The mighty Sultan of Egyptia. Ah Shepherd, pity my distressed plight, (If as thou seem�st, thou art so meana man) And seek not toenrich thy followers, By lawless rapine from a silly maid. Who traveling with these Medean Lords To Memphis, from my uncle�s country of Medea, Where all my youth I have been governed, Have passed the army of the mighty Turk: Bearing his privy signet and his hand: To safe conduct us through Africa: And since we have arrived in Scythia, Besides rich presents from the puissant Cham, We have his highness� letters to command Aid and assistance if we stand in need. But now you see these letters and commands, Are countermanded by a greater man: And through my provinces you must expect Letters ofconduct from my mightiness, If you intend tokeep your treasure safe. But since I love to live atliberty, As easily may you get the Soldan�s crown,As any prizes out ofmy precinct. For theyare friends that help to wean my state, Till men and kingdoms helptostrengthen it: And must maintain my life exempt fromservitude. But tell me Madam, is your grace betrothed? I am (my Lord,) for so you do import.  I am a Lord, for so my deeds shall prove, And yet a shepherd by my Parentage: But Lady, this fair face and heavenly hue, Must grace his bed that conquers Asia: And means tobe a terror tothe world, Measuring the limits of his Empery By East and west, as Phoebus doth his course: Lie here ye weeds that I disdainto wear, This complete armor, and this curtle�axe Are adjuncts more beseeming Tamburlaine. And Madam, whatsoever you esteem Of this success, and loss unvalued, Both may invest you Empress of the East: And these that seem but silly country Swains, May have the leading of so great an host, As with their weight shall make the mountains quake. even as when windy exhalations, Fighting for passage, tilt within the earth. As princely Lions when they rouse themselves, Stretching their paws, and threat�ningherds of Beasts. So in his Armor looketh Tamburlaine: Methinks I see kings kneeling at his feet, And he with frowning brows and fierylooks, Spurning their crowns from off their captive heads. And making thee and me Techelles, kings, That even to death will follow Tamburlaine.Nobly resolved, sweet friends and followers, These Lords (perhaps) do scorn our estimates: And think we prattle with distempered spirits, But since they measure our deserts so mean, That in conceit bear Empires on our spears, Affecting thoughts co�equal with the clouds, They shall be kept our forced followers, Till with their eyes thee view us Emperors. The Gods, defenders of the innocent, Will never prosper your intended drifts, That thusoppress poor friendless passengers. Therefore at least admit us liberty, Even as thou hop�st to be eternized, By living Asia�s mighty Emperor. I hope our Lady�s treasure and our own, May serve for ransom to our liberties: Return our Mules and empty Camels back, That we maytravel into Syria, Where her betrothed Lord Alcidamus, Expects th� arrival of her highness� person. And wheresoever we repose ourselves, We will report but wellof Tamburlaine. Disdains Zenocrate to live with me? Or you my Lords to bemy followers? Think you I weigh this treasure more than you?Not all the Gold in India�s wealthy arms, Shall buy the meanest soldier in my train. Zenocrate, lovelier than the Love of Jove, Brighter than is the silver Rhodolfe, Fairer than whitest snow on Scythian hills, Thyperson is more worth to Tamburlaine, Than the possession of the Persian Crown. Which gracious stars have promised at my birth, A hundreth Tartars shall attendon thee, Mounted on Steeds, swifterthan Pegasus. Thy Garments shall be made of Medean silk, Enchased with precious jewels of mine own: More rich and valorous than Zenocrate�s. With milk�white Hearts upon an ivory sled, Thou shalt be drawn amidst the frozen Pools, And scale the icy mountain�s lofty tops: Which with thy beauty will be soon resolved. My martial prizes with five hundred men, Won on thefifty headed Volga�s waves. Shall all we offer to Zenocrate, And then myself to fair Zenocrate.  What now? In love?Techelles, women must beflattered.But this is she with whom I am in love.Enter a Soldier News, news. How now, what�s the matter? A thousand Persian horsemen are at hand, Sent from the King to overcome us all. How now my Lords of Egypt and Zenocrate? Now must your jewels berestored again: And I that triumphed so be overcome. How say you Lordings, Is not this your hope? We hope yourself will willingly restore them. Such hope, such fortune have the thousand horse. Soft ye my Lords and sweet Zenocrate.You must be forced from me ere you go: A thousand horsemen? We five hundred foot? An odds too great, for us to stand against: But are they rich? And is their armor good? Their plumedhelms arewrought with beaten gold. Their swords enamelled, and about their necks Hangs massy chains of golddown to the waist, Inevery part exceeding brave and rich. Then shall we fight courageously with them. Or look you, I should play theOrator? No: cowards and faint�hearted runaways, Look for orations when the foe is near.Our swords shall play the Orators for us. Come let us meet them at the mountain foot, And with a sudden and an hot alarm Drive all their horses headlong down the hill. Come let us march.Stay Techelles, ask a parley first, The Soldiers EnterOpen theMails, yet guard the treasure sure, Lay out our goldenwedges to the view, That their reflections may amaze the Persians. And look we friendly on them when they come: But if they offer word orviolence, We�ll fight five hundred men at arms to one, Before we part with our possession. And �gainst the General we will lift our swords. And either lance his greedy thirsting throat, Or take himprisoner, and his chainshall serve For Manacles, tillhe be ransomed home. I hear themcome, shall we encounter them? Keep all your standings, and not stir a foot, Myself will bide the danger of the brunt. Enter Theridamas with others.Where is this Scythian Tamburlaine? Whom seek�st thou Persian? I am Tamburlaine. Tamburlaine? A Scythian Shepherd, so embellished With Nature�s pride, and richest furniture, His looks do menace heaven and dare the Gods, His fiery eyes are fixed upon the earth. As if he now devised some Stratagem: Or meant to pierce Avernus� darksome vaults. To pull the tripleheaded dog from hell. Noble and mild this Persian seems to be, If outward habit judge the inward man, His deep affections makehimpassionate. With what a majestyhe rears his looks: Inthee (thou valiant man of Persia) I see the folly of thy Emperor: Art thou but Captain of a thousand horse, That by Charactersgraven in thy brows, And by thy martial face and stout aspect, Deserv�st to have the leading of an host? Forsake thy king and do but join withme And we will triumph over all theworld. I hold the Fates bound fast in iron chains, And with my hand turn Fortune�s wheel about, And sooner shall the Sun fall from his Sphere, Than Tamburlaine be slainor overcome. Draw forth thy sword, thou mighty man at Arms, Intending but to raze my charmed skin: And Jove himself will stretch his handfrom heaven. To ward the blow, and shield me safe from harm, See how he rainsdown heaps of gold in showers.As if he meant to give my Soldiers pay, And as a sure and groundedargument, That I shall be the Monarch of the East. He sends this Souldan�s daughter rich and brave, To be my Queenand portly Empress, If thou wilt stay with me, renowned man, And lead thy thousand horse with my conduct, Besides thy share of this Egyptian prize, Those thousandhorse shall sweat with martial spoil Of conqueredkingdoms, and of Cities sacked, Both we will walk upon the lofty cliffs, And Christian Merchants that with Russian stems Plow up hugefurrows in the Caspian sea. Shall vail to us, as Lords of all the Lake. Both we will reign as Consuls of the earth, And mighty kings shall be our Senators, Jove sometime masked in a Shepherd�s weed, And by those steps that he hath scaled the heavens, May we become immortal like the Gods. join with me now in this my mean estate, (I callit mean, because being yet obscure, The Nations farremoved admire me not) And when my nameand honor shall be spread, As far as Boreas claps his brazen wings, Or fair Bo�tes sends his cheerful light. Then shaltthou be Competitor with me, And sit with Tamburlaine in all his majesty. Not Hermes Prolocutor tothe Gods, Could use persuasions more pathetical. Nor are Apollo�s Oracles more true, Than thou shalt findmy vaunts substantial. We arehis friends, and if the Persian king Should offer present Dukedoms to our state, We think it loss to make exchange for that, We are assured of by our friend�s success. And kingdoms at theleast we all expect. Besides the honor in assured conquests: Where kings shall crouch unto our conquering swords, And hosts of soldiers stand amazed at us, When with their fearful tongues they shall confess These arethe men that all the world admires, What strong enchantments tice my yielding soul Are these resolved noble Scythians? But shall I prove a Traitor to my King? No, but the trusty friend of Tamburlaine. Won withthy words, and conquered with thy looks, I yield myself, my men and horse to thee: To bepartaker of thy good or ill, As long as life maintains Theridamas. Theridamas my friend, take heremy hand. Which is asmuch as if I swore by heaven, And called the Gods to witness of my vow, Thus shall my heart be still combined with thine, Until our bodies turntoElements: And both our souls aspire celestial thrones. Techelles, and Casane, welcome him. Welcome renowned Persian to us all. Long may theridamas remain with us.These are my friends in whom I more rejoice, Than doth the King of Persia in his Crown: And by thelove of Pylades and Orestes,Whose statutes we adore in Scythia, Thyself and them shall never part from me, Before I crown you kings in Asia. Make much of themgentle Theridamas, And they will never leave thee till the death. Nor thee, nor them, thrice noble Tamburlaine Shall want my heart to be with gladness pierced To do youhonor and security. A thousand thanks worthy theridamas: And now fair Madam, and my noble Lords, If you will willingly remain with me, You shall have honors, asyour merits be: Or else you shall be forced with slavery. We yieldunto thee happy Tamburlaine   For you then Madam, I am out of doubt   I must be pleased perforce, wretched ZenocrateExunt Actus. 2. Scaena. 1. Cosroe, Menaphon, Ortygius, Ceneus, withother Soldiers.THus far are we towards Theridamas, And valiant Tamburlaine, theman of fame, The man that in the forehead ofhis fortune, Bears figures of renown and miracle: But tell me, that hastseen him, Menaphon, What stature wields he, and what personage? Of stature tall, and straightlyfashioned, Like his desire, liftupwards and divine, So large of limbs, his joints so strongly knit, Such breadthof shoulders as might mainly bear Old Atlas� burden, �twixt his manly pitch, A pearl more worth, than all the world is placed: Wherein by curious sovereigntyof Art, Are fixed his piercing instruments of sight: Whose fiery circles bear encompassed A heaven of heavenly bodies in their Spheres: That guides his steps and actions to the throne. Where honor sits invested royally: Pale of complexion: wrought in him with passion, Thirsting with sovereignty with love of arms, His lofty brows in folds, do figure death, And in their smoothness, amity and life: About them hangs a knot of Amber hair. Wrapped in curls, as fierce Achilles was, On which the breath of heaven delights to play, Making it dance with wanton majesty: His arms and fingers long and snowy, Betokening valor and excess of strength: In every part proportioned like theman, Should makethe world subdued to Tamburlaine. Well hast thouportrayed in thy terms of life, The face and personage of a wondrous man: Nature doth strive with Fortune and his stars, To make him famous in accomplishedworth: And wellhis merits showhim to be made: His Fortune�s master, and theking of men.That could persuade atsuch a sudden pinch, With reasons of his valor and his life, A thousand sworn and overmatching foes: Then when our powers in points of swords are joined And closed incompass of the killing bullet, Though straightthe passage and theport bemade, That leads to Palace of my brother�s life, Proud is his fortune if we pierce it not. And when the princely Persian Diadem, Shall overweigh his weary witlesshead, And fall like mellowedfruit, with shakes of death, In fair Persia noble tamburlaine Shall be my Regent, and remain as King: In happy hour we haveset theCrown Upon your kingly head, that seeks our honor, In joining with the man, ordained by heaven To further every action to the best. He that with Shepherds and a little spoil, Durst indisdainof wrong and tyranny, Defend his freedom �gainst a Monarchy.What will he do supported by a king? Leading a troop of Gentlemen and Lords, And stuffed with treasurefor his highest thoughts, And such shall wait on worthy Tamburlaine. Our army will be forty thousand strong, When Tamburlaine and brave Theridamas Have met us by the river Araris: And allconjoined to meet the witless King.That now is marching near to Parthia. And with unwilling soldiers faintly armed, To seek revenge on me and Tamburlaine. To whomsweet Menaphon, directme straight. I will my Lord.Exunt                 Act. 2. Scaena. 2,Mycetes, Meander, with other Lordsand Soldiers. COme my Meander, let us to this gear, I tell you truemy heart is swoll�n with wrath, On this samethievish villain tamburlaine. And of that false Cosroe, my traitorous brother Would it not grieve a King to be so abused. And have a thousand horsemen ta�en away? And which is worst to have his Diadem Sought for by such scald knaves as love him not? I thinkit would: well then, by heavens I swear, Aurora shall not peepout of her doors,  But I will have Cosroe by the head, And kill proud Tamburlaine with point of sword. Tell youthe rest (Meander) I have said.Then having passed Armenian deserts now, And pitch our tents under the Georgian hills. Whose tops are covered with Tartarian thieves, That lie in ambush, waiting for a prey: What should we do but bid them battlestraight, And rid the world ofthose detested troops? Lest if welet them linger here a while, They gather strength by powerof fresh supplies. This country swarms with vile outrageous men, That live by rapine and by lawless spoil, Fit Soldiers for the wicked Tamburlaine. And hethat could withgifts and promises. Inveigle him that led a thousand horse, And make him false his faith unto his King, Will quickly winsuch as are like himself. Therefore cheer up your minds, prepare to fight, He that can take orslaughter tamburlaine, Shall rule the Province of Albania. Who brings that Traitor�s head theridamas, Shall have a government in Medea: Beside the spoil of him and all his train: Butif Cosroe (as our �Spials say, And as we know) remains with tamburlaine, His Highness� pleasure is that he should live, And be reclaimed withprincely lenity.An hundred horsemen of my company Scouting abroadupon these champion plains, Have viewed thearmy of the Scythians, Which make reports it far exceeds the Kings. Suppose they be in number infinite, Yet being voidof Martial discipline, All running headlong after greedy spoils: And more regarding gain than victory: Like to the cruel brothers ofthe earth, Sprung of the teeth of Dragons venomous, Their careless swords shalllance their fellow�s throats And make us triumph intheir overthrow. Was theresuch brethren, sweet Meander, say That sprung of teeth ofDragons venomous. So Poets say, my Lord. And �tis a pretty toy to be a Poet. Well, well (Meander) thou art deeply read: And having thee, I have a jewel sure: Go en my Lord, and give your charge I say,      Thywit will make us Conquerors today. Then noble soldiers, to entrap these thieves, That live confounded in disordered troops, If wealth orriches may prevail with them, We have our Camels laden all with gold: Which you that be but common soldiers, Shall fling in every corner of the field: And while the base�born Tartars take it up, You fighting more for honor than for gold, Shall massacre those greedy mindedslaves. And when their scattered army is subdued: And you march on their slaughtered carcases, Share equally the gold that bought their lives, And live like Gentlemen in Persia, Strike up the Drum and march courageously, Fortune herself dothsit upon our Crests.He tells you true, my masters, so hedoes. Drums, why sound ye not when Meander speaks.Exunt         Actus. 2. Scaena. 3. Cosroe, Tamburlaine, Theridamas, Techelles, Usumcasane,Ortygius. with othersNOw worthy Tamburlaine, have I reposed, Inthy approved Fortunes all my hope, What think�st thou man, shall come of our attempts. For even as from assured oracle, I take thy doomfor satisfaction. And so mistake you not a whit my Lord. For Fates and Oracles, heaven have sworn, To royalizethe deeds of tamburlaine: And make them blessed that share in his attempts. And doubt you not, but if you favor me, And let my Fortunes and my valor sway, To some direction inyour martial deeds, The world will strive withhosts of men at arms. To swarm unto the Ensign I support, The host of Xerxes, which by fameis said To drink the mightyParthian Araris, Was but a handful to that we will have. Our quivering Lances shaking in the air, And bullets like Jove�s dreadful Thunderbolts, enrolled in flames and fiery smoldering mists, Shall threat the Gods more than Cyclopian wars, And with our Sun�bright armor aswe march, We�ll chase the Stars from heaven, and dim theireyes That stand and muse at our admired arms. You see my Lord, what working words he hath. But when you see his actions stophis speech, Your speech will stay, or so extol his worth, As I shall be commended and excused For turning my poor charge to his direction. And these his two renowned friends my Lord, Would make one thrust and strive to be retained In such a great degree of amity. With duty not with amitywe yield Our utmost service to thefair Cosroe. Which I esteem as portion of my crown. Usumcasane and techelles both, When she that rules in Rhamnus� golden gates, And makes a passage for all prosperous Arms: Shall make me solely Emperor of Asia, Then shallyour meeds and valors be advancedTo roomsof honor and Nobility. Then haste Cosroe to beking alone. That I with these my friends and all my men, May triumph in our long expected Fate, The King your Brother is now hardat hand, Meet with the fool, and rid your royalshouldersOf such a burden, as outweighs the sands And all the craggy rocks of Caspia. MyLord, we have discovered the enemy Ready to charge you with a mighty army. Come tamburlaine, now whetthy winged sword And lift thy lofty arminto the clouds, That it may reach the King of Persia�s crown, And set it safe on my victorious head. See where it is, the keenestCurtle�axe. That ere made passage thorough Persian Arms, These are the wings shall make it fly as swift, As doth the lightning: or the breath of heaven, And kill as sure as it swiftly flies. Cosroe Thy words assure me of kind success: Go valiant Soldier, go before and charge The fainting army of that foolish King. tamburlaine Usumcasane and techelles come,We are enough to scare the enemy, And more than needs to make an Emperor.To the Battle, and Mycetes comes out alone withhis Crown in his hand offering to hide it. To the Battle, and Mycetes comes out alone with his Crown in his hand offering to hide it. Accursed be he that first invented war, They knew not, ah, they knew not simple men,How those were hit by pelting Cannon shot, Stand staggering like a quiveringAspen leaf, Fearing theforce of Boreas� boisterous blasts. In what a lamentablecase were I, If Nature had not given me wisdom�s lore? For Kings are clouts that every manshoots at,Our Crown thepin that thousands seek to cleave, Therefore in policy I thinkit good To hide it close: a goodly Stratagem, And far from any man that is a fool. So shall not I be known, or ifI be, They cannot take away my crown from me. Here will I hide it in this simple hole.Enter Tamburlaine.What fearful coward straggling from the camp When Kingsthemselves are present in the field. Thou liest. Base villain, dar�st thou give the lie? Away, I am the King: go, touch menot. Thou break�st the law of Arms unless thou kneel. And cry me mercy, noble King. Are youthe witty King of Persia?Ay marry amI: have you any suit to me? I would entreat you to speak but three wise words. So I can when I see my time.Is this your Crown? Ay, Didst thou ever see a fairer? You will not sell it, will ye? Such another word, and I willhave thee executed. Come give it me. No, I took it prisoner. You lie, I gave it you.  Then �tis mine. No, I mean, I let you keep it. Well, I mean you shall have it again. Here take it for a while, I lend it thee, Till I may see thee hemmed with armed men. Then shalt thou see me pull it from thy head: Thou art no match for mighty Tamburlaine. O Gods, is this tamburlaine the thief,I marvel much he stole it not away.Sound trumpets to the battle, and he runs in.Cosroe, Tamburlaine, Theridamas, Menaphon,Meander, Ortygius, Techelles.

Thinks thee Invested now as royally, Even by the mighty hand of tamburlaine,As if as many kings as could encompass thee, With greatest pomp had crownedthee Emperor. Cosroe So do I thrice renowned man at arms, And none shall keep the crown but tamburlaine: Thee do I make my Regent of Persia, And General Lieutenant of my Armies. Meander, you that were our brother�s Guide, And chiefest Counselor inall his acts, Since heis yielded to the stroke of War, On your submission we with thanks excuse, And give you equal place inour affairs. Most happy Emperor in humblest terms I vow my serviceto your Majesty.With utmost virtue of my faith and duty. Thanks good Meander, then Cosroe reign And govern Persia in her former pomp: Now send Ambassagetothy neighbor Kings, And let themknow the Persian King is changed: From one that knew not whata King should do, To one that can commandwhat longs thereto: And now we will to fair Persepolis, With twentythousand expert soldiers. The Lords and Captains of my brother�s camp, With little slaughter take Meander�s course,And gladly yield them to my gracious rule: Ortygius and menaphon, my trusty friends, Now will I gratify your former good, And grace your calling witha greater sway. And as we ever and atyour behoof, And sought your state, all honor it deserved, So will we with our powers and our lives, Endeavor to preserve and prosper it. I will not thank thee (sweet Ortygius)Better replies shall prove my purposes. And now, Lord tamburlaine, my brother�s Camp I leave to thee, and to theridamas, To follow me to fair Persepolis. Then will we march to all those Indian Mines, My witless brother to the Christians lost: And ransom them with fame and usury. And till thou overtake me tamburlaine, (Staying to order all the scattered troops) Farewell Lord Regent, and his happy friends, I long to sit upon my brother�s throne, Your Majesty shall shortly have your wish. And ride in triumph through Persepolis.ExuntManent Tamburlaine Techelles Theridamas UsumcasaneAnd ride in triumph through Persepolis? Is it not brave tobe a King, techelles?Usumcasane and theridamas, Is it not passing brave to be a King, And ride in triumph through Persepolis?  O my Lord, �tis sweet and full of pomp.To be a King, is half to bea God.A God is not so glorious as a King: I think the pleasure they enjoy in heaven Can not compare withkingly joys in earth, To wear a Crown enchased with pearland gold, Whose virtues carry with it life and death, To ask, and have: command, and beobeyed. When looks breed love, with looks to gain the prize. Such powerattractive shinesinprinces� eyes. Why say theridamas, wilt thou be a king? Nay, though I praise it, I can live without it. What says my other friends, will you be kings? Ay, if I could withall my heart my Lord. Why, that�s well said techelles, so wouldI, And so would you my masters, would you not?What then my Lord? Why then Casane shall we wish for ought The world affords in greatest novelty, And rest attemptless faint and destitute? Methinks we should not, I am strongly moved, That if I should desire the Persian Crown, I could attain it with a wondrousease, And wouldnot all our soldiers soon consent, If we should aim at such a dignity? I know they would with our persuasions. Why then theridamas, I�ll first assay, To get the Persian Kingdom to myself: Then thou for Parthia, they for Scythia and Medea. And if I prosper, all shall be as sure, As if the Turk, the Pope, Afric and Greece,Came creeping tous with their crowns apace. Then shall we send to this triumphing King, And bid him battle for his novel Crown? Nay quickly then, before his room be hot. �Twill prove a pretty jest (infaith) my friends.      A jest to charge on twenty thousandmen? I judge the purchase more importantfar. Judge by thyself theridamas, not me, For presently techelles here shall haste,To bid him battle ere he pass too far, And lose more labor than the gain will quite. Then shalt thou see the Scythian tamburlaine, Make but ajest to win the Persian crown. techelles, take a thousand horse with thee, And bid him turn his back to war with us, That only made him King to make us sport. We will not steal upon himcowardly, But givehim warning and morewarriors. Haste thee techelles, we willfollow thee. What saith theridamas? Go on for me.Exunt Actus. 2. Scaena. 6. Cosroe, Meander, Ortygius, Menaphon, withother SoldiersWhat means this devilish shepherdto aspire With such a Giantly presumption. To cast up hills against the face of heaven: And dare the force of angry Jupiter. But as he thrust them underneath the hills, And pressed out fire from their burning jaws: So will I send this monstrous slave to hell, Where flames shall ever feed upon his soul. Some powers divine, or else infernal, mixed Their angry seeds athis conception: For he was never sprung ofhuman race, Since withthe spirit of his fearful pride, He dares so doubtlessly resolve of rule. And by profession be ambitious. What God or Fiend, or spirit ofthe earth, Or Monster turned to a manly shape, Or of what mold or metal he be made, What star or statesoever govern him, Let us put on our meet encount�ring minds, And in detesting such a devilish Thief, Inlove of honor and defense of right, Be armed against the hate of such a foe, Whether from earth, or hell, or heaven he grow.  Nobly resolved, my good Ortygius. And since we all have sucked one wholesome air, And with the same proportion ofElements, Resolve, I hope we areresembled, Vowing our loves to equal death and life,Let�s cheer our soldiers to encounter him, That grievous imageof ingratitude: That fiery thirster after Sovereignty: And burn him in the fury of that flame,That none can quench but blood and Empery. Resolve my Lords and lovingsoldiers now, To save your King and country from decay: Then strike up Drum, and all the Stars that make The loathsome Circle of my dated life, Direct my weapon tohis barbarous heart, That thus opposeth him against the Gods, And scorns the Powers that govern Persia. Enter to the Battle, and after the battle, enter Cosroewounded, Theridamas, tamburlaine, Techelles,Usumcasane, with others.Barbarous and bloody Tamburlaine, Thus to depriveme ofmy crown and life. Treacherous and false theridamas, Even at the morning of my happy state, Scarce being seated inmy royalthrone, To work my downfall and untimely end. An uncouth pain torments my grievedsoul, And death arrests the organ of my voice. Who ent�ring at the breach thy sword hathmade, Sacks every vain and artier of my heart, Bloody and insatiate Tamburlaine. The thirst of reign and sweetness of a crown, That caused the eldest son of heavenly Ops, To thrust his doting father from his chair, And place himselfinthe Imperial heaven, Moved me to manage arms against they state, Whatbetter precedent than mighty Jove? Nature that framed us of four Elements, Warring within our breasts for regiment, Doth teach us all to have aspiring minds: Our souls, whose faculties can comprehend The wondrousArchitecture of the world: And measure every wand�ring planets course. Still climbing after knowledge infinite, And alwaysmoving as the restless Spheres. Wills us to wear ourselves and never rest. Until we reach the ripest fruit of all. That perfect bliss and sole felicity. The sweet fruition of an earthly crown. And that made me to join with tamburlaine For he is gross and like the massy earth, That moves not upwards, nor by princelydeeds Doth mean to soarabove thehighestsort. And that made us thefriends of Tamburlaine. To lift our swords against the Persian King. For as when Jove did thrust old Saturn down, Neptune and Dis gained each ofthem a Crown. So do we hope to reign in Asia, If tamburlaine be placed in Persia. The strangest men that ever nature made, I know not how to take their tyrannies. My bloodless body waxeth chill and cold, And with my blood my life slides through my wound. My soul begins to take her flightto hell. And summons all my senses to depart: The heat and moisture which did feed each other, For want of nourishment tofeed them both. Is dry and cold, and now dothghastly death With greedy talons gripe my bleeding heart, And like a Harpy tires on my life. Theridamas and Tamburlaine, I die, And fearful vengeance light upon you both. He takes the Crown and puts it onNot all the curses which the furies breathe, Shall make me leaveso rich a prizeas this: Theridamas, techelles, and the rest, Who think you now is king of Persia? Tamburlaine, tamburlaine. Though Mars himself the angry God of arms, And all the earthly Potentates conspire, To dispossess me ofthis Diadem: Yet will I wear it in despite of them, As great commander ofthis Easternworld, If youbut say that tamburlaine shall reign. Long live tamburlaine, andreign in Asia. So, now it ismore surer on my head, Than if the Gods had helda Parliament: And all pronounced me king of Persia. Finis Actus 2. Actus. 3. Scaena. 1.

GReat Kings of Barbary, and my portly Bassoes, We hear, theTartars and the Eastern thieves Under the conduct of one Tamburlaine, Presumea bickering withyour Emperor: And thinks to rouseus from our dreadful siege Of the famous Grecian Constantinople. You know our Army is invincible: As many circumcised Turks we have, And warlike bands of Christians renayed, As hath the Ocean or the Terrene sea Small drops of water, when the Moon begins To join in one her semicircled horns: Yet would we not be braved with foreign power, Nor raise our siege before the Gretians yield. Or breathless lie before the city walls. Renowned Emperor, and mightyGeneral What if you sent the Bassoes of your guard. To charge him to remain in Asia. Or else to threaten death and deadly arms, As from the mouthof mighty Bajazeth. Hie thee my Basso fast to Persia, Tell him thy Lord the Turkish Emperor, Dread Lord of Afric, Europe and Asia. Great King and conqueror of Grecia, The Ocean, Terrene, and the coal�black sea, The high and highest Monarch ofthe world. Wills and Commands(for say not I entreat) Not once to set his foot in Africa, Or spread his colors in Grecia. Lest heincur the fury of my wrath. Tell him, I amcontent to take a truce, Because I hear he bears a valiant mind. But if presuming on his sillypower, He be so mad to manage Arms withme, Then stay thou with him, say I bid thee so. And if before the Sun have measuredheaven With triple circuit thou regreet us not, We meantotake his morning�s next arise. For messenger, hewill not be reclaimed, And mean to fetch thee in despite ofhim. Most great and puissant Monarch of the earth, Your Basso will accomplish your behest: And show your pleasure to the Persian. As fits the Legate of the stately Turk.               Exit Basso  They say he is the King of Persia. But if he dare attempt to stir your siege, �Twere requisite he should be ten times more, For all flesh quakes at your magnificence. True (Argier) and tremble at my looks. The spring is hindered by your smothering host, For neither rain can fall upon the earth, Nor Sun reflex his virtuous beams thereon. The ground is mantled with such multitudes. All this is true as holy Mahomet, And all thetrees are blasted with our breathes.What thinks your greatness best to be achieved In pursuit of the City�s overthrow? I will the captive Pioneers of Argier, Cutof the water, that by leaden pipes Runs to the city from the mountain Carnon, Two thousand horse shall forage up and down, Thatno reliefor succor come by Land. And all thesea my Galleys countermand. Then shall our footmen lie within the trench, And with their Cannons mouthed like Orcus� gulf Batter the walls, and we willenter in: And thus the Grecians shall be conquered. ExuntActus. 3. Scaena. 2. Agydas, Zenocrate, Anippe, withothers. Zenocrate may I presume To know the cause of these unquiet fits: That work such trouble to your wonted rest: �Tis more than pity such a heavenly face Should by heart�s sorrow wax so wan and pale. When your offensive rape by tamburlaine, (Which of your whole displeasures should be most) Hath seemed to be digested longago. Although it be digested long ago, As his exceeding favors have deserved, And might content the Queenof heaven as well: As it hath changed my first conceived disdain. Yet since a farther passion feeds my thoughts, With ceaseless and disconsolate conceits. Which dies my looks so livelessas they are. And might, if my extremes had full events, Make me the ghastly counterfeitof death. Eternal heaven sooner be dissolved. And all that pierceth Phoebe�s silver eye, Before such hap fall to zenocrate. Ah, life, and soul still hover in his Breast. And leave my body senseless asthe earth. Or else unite you to his life and soul, That I may live and die with tamburlaine. Enter Tamburlaine with Techelles and othersWith tamburlaine? Ahfair zenocrate. Let not a man so vileand barbarous, That holds you from your father in despite, And keeps you from the honors of a Queen. Being supposed his worthless Concubine. Be honored with your love, but for necessity. So now themighty Soldan hears of you, Your Highness needs not doubt but in short time, He will with Tamburlaine�s destruction Redeem you from this deadly servitude. leave to wound mewith these words. And speak of tamburlaine as hedeserves: The entertainmentwe have had of him, Is far from villainy or servitude. And might in noble minds be countedprincely. How can you fancy one that looks so fierce, Only disposed to martial Stratagems? Who when he shall embraceyou in his arms, Will tellhow many thousand men he slew. And when you look for amorous discourse, Will rattle forth his facts of war and blood. Too harsh a subject for your dainty ears. As looks thesun through Nilus� flowing stream, Or when the morning holds himin her arms. So looks my Lordly love, fair tamburlaine: His talk much sweeter than the Muse�s song, They sung for honor �gainst Pierides. Or when Minerva did with Neptune strive, And higher would I rear my estimate, Than Juno sister to the highest God. If I were matched with mighty tamburlaine. Yet be not so inconstant in your love, But let the young Arabian live in hope, After your rescue to enjoy his choice. You see though first the King of Persia (Being a Shepherd) seemed to love youmuch, Now in his majesty he leaves those looks, Those words of favor, and those comfortings, And gives no more thancommon courtesies. Thence rise the tears that so distain my cheeks, Fearing his love through my unworthiness. Tamburlaine goes to her, and takes her away lovinglyby the hand, looking wrathfully on Agydas,and says nothing.Betrayed by fortune and suspiciouslove. Threatened with frowning wrath and jealousy. Surprised with fear of hideous revenge. I stand aghast: but most astonied To see his choler shut in secretthoughts, And wrapped in silence of his angry soul. Upon his brows was portrayed ugly death, And in his eyes the fury of his heart. That shine as Comets, menacing revenge, And casts a pale complexion on his cheeks. As when theSeaman sees the Hyades Gather an armyof Cemerian clouds, (Auster and Aquilon with winged Steeds All sweating, tilt about the watery heavens, With shivering spears enforcing thunderclaps. And from their shields strike flames of lightning) All fearfulfolds his sails, and sounds the main, Lifting his prayersto the heavens for aid, Against the terror of thewinds and waves. So fares Agydas for the late felt frowns That senta tempest to my daunted thoughts, And makes my soul divine her overthrow. Enter Techelles with a naked dagger.See you Agydas how the King salutes you. He bids you prophesy what it imports.Exit I prophesied before and now I prove, The killing frowns of jealousy and love. He needed not withwords confirm my fear, For words are vain where working tools present The naked action of my threatened end. It says, Agidas, thou shalt surely die. And of extremities elect theleast, More honor and less painit may procure, To die by this resolved hand of thine, Than stay the torments he and heaven have sworn. Then haste Agydas, and prevent the plagues: Which thy prolonged Fates may draw on thee: Go wander free from fear of Tyrant�s rage.Removed from the Torments and the hell: Wherewith he may excruciate thy soul. And let Agydas by Agydas die. And withthis stab slumber eternally. Usumcasane, see how rightthe man Hath hit the meaning of my Lord the King. Faith, and techelles, it was manly done: And since he was so wise and honorable, Letus afford him now thebearing hence. And crave his triple worthy burial. Agreed Casane, we will honor him. Act. 3.

Turks are full of brags And menace more thanthey can well perform: He meet me in the field and fetch thee hence? Alas (poor Turk) his fortune is too weak, T� encounter with the strength of Tamburlaine. View well my Camp, and speak indifferently, Do not my captains and my soldiers look As if theymeant to conquer Africa. Your men are valiant but their number few, And cannot terrify his mighty host, My Lord, the great Commander of the world, Besides fifteen contributory kings, Hath now in arms ten thousand Janissaries, Mounted on lusty Mauritanian Steeds. Brought to the war by men of Tripoli. Two hundred thousand footmen that have served In two set battles foughtin Grecia: And for the expedition of this war, If he think good, can from his garrisons, Withdraw as many more to follow him.The morehe brings, thegreater is the spoil, For when they perish by our warlike hands, We mean to seat our footmen on their Steeds. And rifle all those stately Janisars. But will those Kings accompany your Lord? Such as his Highness please, but some must stay To rule the provinces he late subdued. Thenfight courageously, their crowns are yours This hand shall set them on your conquering heads: That made meEmperor of Asia.  Let him bring millions infinite of men, Unpeopling Western Africa and Greece: Yet we assure us of the victory. even he that ina trice vanquishedtwo kings, More mighty than theTurkish Emperor: Shall rouse him out of Europe, and pursue His scattered army till they yield or die. Well said theridamas, speak in that mood, For Will and Shall best fitteth Tamburlaine, Whose smilingstars gives himassured hope Of martial triumph, ere he meethis foes: I that am termed the Scourge and Wrath of God, The only fear and terror of the world, Will first subdue the Turk, and then enlarge Those Christian Captives, which you keep as slaves, Burdening their bodies with your heavy chains. And feeding them with thin and slender fare, That naked row about the Terrene sea. And when they chance to breathe and rest a space, Are punished with Bastones so grievously, That they lie panting on the Galley�s side. And strive for life at every stroke theygive, These are the cruel pirates of Argier, That damnedtrain, the scum of Africa. Inhabited with straggling Runagates, That make quick havoc of the Christianblood. But as I live that town shallcurse the time That Tamburlaine set foot in Africa: Enter Bajazeth with his Bassoes and contributoryKings.Bassoes and Janissaries of my Guard, Attend upon the person of your Lord, The greatestPotentate of Africa. Techelles, and therest prepare your swords I mean t� encounter withthat Bajazeth. Kings of Fez, Moroccus and Argier, He calls me Bajazeth, whom you call Lord. Note the presumption of this Scythian slave: I tell thee villain, those that lead my horse Have to theirnames titles of dignity, And dar�st thou bluntly callme Bajazeth? And know thou Turk, that those which lead my horse, Shall lead thee Captive through Africa. And dar�st thou bluntly callme tamburlaine? By Mahomet, my Kinsman�s sepulcher. And by theholy Alcoran I swear, He shall be made a chaste and lustless Eunuch, And in my Serail tend my Concubines: And all his Captains that thusstoutly stand, Shall draw thechariot of my Empress. Whom I have brought to see their overthrow. By this my sword that conquered Persia, Thy fall shall make me famous through the world: I will not tell thee how I�ll handle thee, But every common soldier ofmy Camp Shall smiletosee thy miserable state. What means the mighty Turkish Emperor To talk with one so base as tamburlaine. Ye Moors and valiant men of Barbary. How can ye suffer these indignities. Leave words and let them feel your lances� points. Which glided through thebowels of theGreeks. Well said my stout contributory kings, Your threefold army and my hugy host, Shall swallow up these base�born Persians, Puissant, renowned and mighty tamburlaine, Why stay we thus prolonging all their lives? I long to see those crowns won by our swords That we may reign as kings of Africa. What Coward would not fight for such a prize? Fight all courageously and be you kings. I speak it, and my words are oracles. Zabina, mother of three braver boys, Than Hercules, that in his infancy Did pash the jaws of Serpents venomous: Whose hands are made to gripe a warlikeLance. Their shoulders broad, for completearmor fit, Their limbs more large and ofa bigger size Than all the brats y�sprung from Typhon�s loins: Who, when theycome unto their father�s age, Will batter Turrets with their manly fists. Sit here upon this royal chair of state, And on thy head wearmy Imperial crown, Until I bring this sturdy tamburlaine, And all his Captains bound in captive chains. Such good success happen to Bajazeth, zenocrate, the loveliest Maid alive, Fairer than rocks of pearl and precious stone, The only Paragon of tamburlaine, Whose eyes are brighter than the Lamps of heaven. And speech more pleasant than sweet harmony: That with thy looks canst clear thedarkened Sky: And calm the rage of thund�ring Jupiter: Sit down by her: adorned with my Crown, As if thou wertthe Empress of the world. Stir not zenocrate until thou see Me march victoriously with all my men, Triumphing over him and these his kings. Which I will bring as Vassals to thy feet. Tillthen take thou my crown, vaunt of my worth, And manage words with her as we willarms. And may my Love, the king of Persia Return with victory, and free from wound. Now shalt thoufeel the force of Turkish arms, Which lately made all Europe quake for fear: I have of Turks, Arabians, Moors and Jews Enough to cover all Bithynia, Letthousands die, their slaughtered Carcases Shall serve for walls and bulwarks tothe rest: And as the heads of Hydra, so my power Subdued, shall stand as mighty as before: If they should yieldtheir necks unto the sword, Thy soldiers arms could not endure to strike So many blows as I have heads for thee. Thou knowest not (foolish hardy Tamburlaine) What �tis to meet me in theopen field, That leave no ground for thee to march upon. Our conquering swords shall marshal us the way We use to march upon the slaughtered foe: Trampling their bowels with our horses hoofs: Brave horses, bred on the white Tartarian hills: My Camp is like to julius Caesar�s host, Thatnever fought but had the victory: Nor in Pharsalia was there such hot war, As these my followers willingly would have: Legions of Spirits fleeting inthe air, Direct our Bullets and our weapons� points And make our strokes to wound the senseless lure, And when she sees our bloodyColors spread. Then Victory begins to take her flight, Resting herselfupon my milk�white Tent: But come my Lords, to weaponslet us fall. The field is ours, the Turk, his wife and all. Exit, with his followersCome Kings and Bassoeslet us glut our swords Thatthirst to drink the feeble Persians� blood. Exit, with his followersBase Concubine, must thou be placed by me Thatam the Empress of the mighty Turk? Disdainful Turkess and unreverend Boss, Call�st thou me Concubine that am betrothed Unto thegreat and mighty tamburlaine? To tamburlaine the great Tartarian thief? Thou wilt repent these lavish words of thine, When thy great Basso, master and thyself. Must plead for mercy at his kingly feet, And sue to me to be your Advocates. And sue to thee? I tellthee shameless girl, Thou shaltbe Laundress to my waiting maid. How lik�st thou her Ebea, will she serve? Madam, she thinks perhaps sheis too fine. But I shall turn her into other weeds. And make her dainty fingers fallto work. hear�st thou Anippe, how thy drudge doth talk, And how my slave, her mistress menaceth. Both for their sauciness shall be employed, To dress thecommon soldiers� meat and drink. For we will scorn they should come near ourselves. Yet sometimes let your highness send for them To do the work my chamber maid disdains. They sound the battle within, and stayYe Gods and powers that govern Persia. And made my lordly Love her worthy King: Now strengthen himagainst the Turkish Bajazeth, And let his foes like flocks of fearful Roes, Pursued by hunters, fly his angry looks, ThatI maysee him issue Conqueror. Now Mahomet, solicit God himself, And make him rain down murdering shot from heaven To dash the Scythians brains, and strike themdead, That dare to manage arms with him, That offered jewels tothy sacred shrine. When first he warred against the Christians. To the battle again.By this the Turks liewelt�ring in their blood And tamburlaine is Lord of Africa: Thou art deceived, I heard the Trumpets sound, As when my Emperor overthrew theGreeks: And led them Captive into Africa. Straight will I use thee asthy pride deserves: Prepare thyself to live and diemy slave. If Mahomet should come from heaven and swear, My royal Lord is slain or conquered.  Yet should he not persuade me otherwise.  But that he lives and will be Conqueror.  Bajazeth flies, and he pursues him.The battle short, and they enter,Bajazeth is overcomeNow king of Bassoes, who is Conqueror?  Thou, by the fortune of this damned soil,  Where are your stout contributory kings? Enter Techelles, Theridamas, Usumcasane.We have their crowns their bodies strew  the field.  Each man a crown? why kingly fought i� faith  Deliver them into my treasury.  Now let me offer to my gracious Lord.  His royal Crown again, so highly won:  Nay take the Turkish Crown from her, zenocrate  And crown me Emperor of Africa.  No tamburlaine, though now thou gat the best  Thou shalt not yet be Lord of Africa.     Giveher the Crown Turkess you were best. Injurious villains, thieves, runagates, How dare you thus abuse my Majesty? Here Madam, you are Empress, she is none. Not now theridamas, her time is past: The pillars that have bolstered up those terms, Are fall�n in clusters at my conquering feet. Though he be prisoner, he may be ransomed: Not all the world shall ransom Bajazeth. Ah fair zabina, we have lost the field. And never had theTurkish Emperor So great a foil by any foreignfoe. Now will the Christian miscreants be glad, Ringing with joy their superstitious bells: And making bonfires for my overthrow. But ereI diethose foul Idolaters Shall make me bonfires withtheir filthy bones, For though the glory of this day be lost. Afric and Greece have garrisons enough To make me Sovereign of the earth again. Those walled garrisons willI subdue, And write myself great Lord of Africa: So from the East unto the furthest West, Shall tamburlaine extend his puissantarm. The Galleys and those pilling Brigandines, That yearly sail to the Venetian gulf,  And hover in the straits for Christians� wrack,  Shall lie at anchor in the Isle Asant.  Until the Persian Fleet and men of war,  Sailing along the Oriental sea,  Have fetched about the Indian continent:  Even from Persepolis to Mexico,  And thence unto the straits of Jubalter:  Where they shall meet, and join their force in one.  Keeping in awe the Bay of Portingale.  And all the Ocean by the British shore:  And by this means I�ll win the world at last.  Yet set a ransom on me tamburlaine.  What, thinkst thou tamburlaine esteems thy gold,  I�ll make the kings of India ere I die,  Offer their mines (to sue for peace) to me,  And dig for treasure to appease my wrath:  Come bind them both and one lead in the Turk.  The Turkess let my Love�s maid lead away.  They bind them.Ah villains, dare ye touch my sacred arms.  O Mahomet, O sleepy Mahomet.  O cursed Mahomet that makest us thus  The slaves to Scythians rude and barbarous.  Come bring them in, and for this happy conquest  Triumph, and solemnize a martial feast.  ExuntFinis Actus tertii.

Hath spread his colors to our high disgrace:  While you faint�hearted base Egyptians,  Lie slumbering on the flow�ry banks of Nile,  As Crocodiles that unaffrighted rest,  While thund�ring Cannonsrattle on their Skins. Nay (mighty Soldan) did your greatness see  The frowning looks of fiery Tamburlaine,That with his terror and imperious eyes, Commands the hearts of his associates, It might amazeyour royalmajesty. Villain. I tell thee, were that tamburlaine, As monstrous as Gorgon, prince of Hell, The Soldan would not start a foot from him. But speak, what power hathhe? Mighty Lord, Three hundred thousand men in armor clad, Upon their prancing Steeds, disdainfully With wanton paces trampling on the ground. Five hundred thousandfootmen threat�ning shot, Shaking their swords, their spears and iron bills, Environing their Standard round, that stood As bristle�pointed as a thorny wood. Their warlike Engines and munition Exceed theforces of their martial men. Nay could their numbers countervail the stars Or ever drizzling drops of April showers, Or withered leaves that autumnshaketh down. Yet would the Soldan by his conquering power: So scatter and consumethem in his rage, That not a manshould live to rue their fall, So might your highness, had you time to sort Your fighting men, and raise your royal host.But tamburlaine, by expedition Advantage takes of your unreadiness.Lethim take all th�advantages he can, Were all the world conspired to fight for him, Nay, were he Devil, as he is no man, Yet in revenge of fair Zenocrate, Whom he detainethin despiteof us, This arm should send him down to Erebus. To shroud his shameindarkness of the night. Pleaseth your mightiness to understand, His resolution far exceedeth all: The first day when he pitcheth down his tents, White is their hue, and on his silver crest A snowy Feather spangled white he bears, To signify the mildness of his mind. That satiate with spoil refuseth blood: But when Aurora mounts the second time, As red as scarlet is his furniture, Then must his kindledwrath be quenched with blood. Not sparing any that can manage arms: But if these threats move not submission. Black are his colors, black Pavilion, His spear, his shield, his horse, his armor, plumes, And Jetty Feathers menace death and hell,  Without respect of Sex, degree or age.  He raceth all his foes with fire and sword.  Merciless villain, Peasant ignorant,  Of lawful arms, or martial discipline:  Pillage and murder are his usual trades.  The slave usurps the glorious name of war.  See Capolin the fair Arabian king,  That hath been disappointed by this slave:  Of my fair daughter, and his princelyLove: May have fresh warning to go war with us, And be revenged for her disparagement.

But ere I march to wealthy Persia, Or leave Damascus and th� Egyptian fields, As was the fame of Clymene�s brainsick son, That almost brent the Axle�treeof heaven,So shall our swords, our lances and our shot.  Fill all the air with fiery meteors.  Then when the Sky shall wax as red as blood,  It shall be said, I made it red myself,  To make me think of naught but blood and war.   Unworthy king, that by thy cruelty,  Unlawfully usurpest the Persian seat:  Dar�st thou that never saw an Emperor,  Before thou met my husband in the field,  Being thy Captive, thus abuse his state,  Keeping his kingly body in a Cage,  That roofs of gold, and sun�bright Palaces,  Should have prepared to entertain his Grace?  And treading him beneath thy loathsome feet,  Whose feet the kings of Africa have kissed.  You must devise some torment worse, my Lord  To make these captives rein their lavish tongues.   zenocrate, look better to your slave:  She is my Handmaid�s slave, and she shall look  That these abuses flow not from her tongue:  Chide her Anippe.   Let these be warnings for you then my slave,  How you abuse the person of the king:  Or else I swear to have you whipped stark naked.  Great tamburlaine, great in my overthrow,  Ambitious pride shall make thee fall as low.  For treading on the back of Bajazeth,  That should be horsed on four mighty kings.  Thy names and titles, and thy dignities  Are fled from Bajazeth, and remain with me,  That will maintain it against a world of Kings.  Put him in again.  Is this a placefor mighty Bajazeth? Confusion light on him that helps thee thus.There whiles he lives, shall Bajazeth be kept, And where I go be thus in triumph drawn: And thouhis wife shalt feed him with the scraps My servitures shall bring thee frommy board. For he that gives him other food than this: Shall sit by himand starve to death himself. This is my mind, and I will haveit so. Not all the Kings and Emperors of the Earth: If they would lay their crowns before my feet, Shall ransom him, or take him from his cage. The ages that shall talk of Tamburlaine, Even fromthis day to Plato�s wondrous year, Shall talk how I have handled Bajazeth. These Moors that drew himfrom Bithynia, To fair Damascus, where we now remain, Shall lead himwith us wheresoe�er we go. Techelles, and my lovingfollowers, Now may we see Damascus� lofty towers, Like to the shadows of Pyramids, That with their beauties graced the Memphian fields: The golden stature of their feathered bird That spreads her wings upon the city walls, Shall not defend it from our battering shot. The townsmen mask in silk and cloth of gold. And every house is as a treasury. The men, the treasure, and the town isours.Your tentsof white now pitched before the gates And gentle flags of amity displayed. I doubt not but the Governor will yield, Offering Damascus to your Majesty. So shall he have his life, and all the rest. But if he stay until the bloody flag Be once advanced on my vermilion Tent, He dies, and those that kept us out so long. And when they see memarch in black array, With mournful streamers hanging down their heads, Were in that city allthe world contained. Not one should �scape: but perish by our swords. Yet would you havesome pity for my sake, Because it is my country�s, and my Father�s. Not for the world Zenocrate, if I havesworn: Come bring in the Turk.ExuntAct. 4. Scaena. 3, Soldan, Arabia, Capoline, with streaming colorsand SoldiersMEthinks we march as Meleager did, Environed with brave Argolian knights: To chase thesavage Caldonian Boar, Or Cephalus with lusty Theban youths. Against the Wolf that angry Themis sent. To waste and spoil thesweet Aonian fields. Amonster of five hundred thousand heads, Compact ofRapine, Piracy, and spoil. The Scum of men, the hate and Scourge of God, Raves in Egyptia, and annoyeth us. My Lord it is the bloody Tamburlaine. A sturdy Felon and a base�bred Thief. By murder raised to the Persian Crown. That dares control us in our Territories. To tame the pride of this presumptuous Beast,  join your Arabians with the Soldan�s power:  Let us uniteour royalbands inone,  And hasten toremove Damascus� siege.  It is a blemish to the Majesty  And high estate of mighty Emperors,  That such a base usurping vagabond  Should brave a king, or wear a princely crown.  Renowned Soldan, have ye lately heard  The overthrow of mighty Bajazeth,  About the confines of Bithynia?  The slavery wherewith hepersecutes  The noble Turk and his great Empress.I have, and sorrow for his bad success:  But noble Lord of great Arabia,  Be so persuaded, that the Soldan is  No more dismayed withtidings of his fall, Than in the haven when the Pilotstands And views a stranger�s ship rent in the winds, And shivered against a craggy rock, Yet in compassion of his wretched state, A sacred vow toheavenand him I make, Confirming it with Ibis� holy name, That Tamburlaine shall rue the day, the hour, Wherein he wrought such ignominious wrong. Unto the hallowed person of a prince, Or kept the fair zenocrate so long. As Concubine, I fear to feed his lust. Letgrief and fury hasten on revenge, Let Tamburlaine for his offenses feel Such plagues asheaven and we can pour on him. I long to break my spear upon his creAnd prove the weight of his victorious arm: For Fame I fear hath been too prodigal: In sounding through the world his partial praise: Capolin, hast thou surveyed our powers. Great Emperors of Egypt and Arabia. The number of your hosts united is, A hundred and fifty thousand horse, Two hundred thousand foot, brave menat arms, Courageous and full of hardiness: As frolic asthe hunters inthe chase: Of savage beasts amid the desert woods. My mind presagethfortunate success, And tamburlaine, my spirit doth foresee The utter ruinof thy menand thee. Thenrear your standards, let your sounding Drums Direct our Soldiers to Damascus� walls. Now Tamburlaine, the mighty Soldan comes, And leads with him the great Arabian King. To dim thy baseness and obscurity. Famous for nothing but for theft and spoil, To race and scatter thy inglorious crew, Of Scythians and slavish Persians. ExuntActus: 4.

Reflexing hues of blood upon their heads. While they walk quivering on their city walls, Half dead for fear before they feel my wrath: Then let us freely banquet and carouse Full bowls of wine unto the God of war, That means to fill your helmets full of gold: And make Damascus� spoils as rich toyou, As was to Jason Colchos� golden fleece. And now Bajazeth, hast thou any stomach? Ay, such a stomach (cruel tamburlaine) as I could Willingly feed upon thy blood�raw heart. Nay, thine own is easier to come by, pluck out that, And �twill serve thee and thy wife: Well zenocrate, techelles, and the rest, fall to your victuals. Fall to, and never may your meatdigest. Ye Furies that can mask invisible, Dive to the bottom of Avernus� pool, And in your hands bring hellish poison up. And squeeze it in the cup of tamburlaine. Or winged snakes of Lerna cast your stings, And leave your venoms in this Tyrant�s dish. And may this banquet prove as ominous, As Progne�s to th�adulterous Thracian King. That fed upon the substance of his child. My Lord, how can you suffer these outrageous curses By these slaves of yours? To let them see (divine zenocrate) I glory inthe curses of my foes. Having the power from the Imperial heaven, To turn them all upon their properheads. I pray you give them leave Madam, this speech is a goodly refreshing to them. But if his highnesswould let them be fed, it  would do them more good.Sirrah, why fallyou not too, are you so daintily  brought up, youcannot eat your own flesh?  First legions of devils shall tear thee in pieces.  Villain, knowest thou to whomthou speakest  O let him alone: here, eat sir, take it frommy  sword�s point, or I�ll thrust it to thy heart.  He stamps it under his feet my Lord.  Take it up Villain and eatit, or I will make  thee slice the brawns of thy arms into carbonadoes,  and eatthem.  Nay, �twere better hekilled his wife, and then she shall be sure not to be starved, and hebe provided for a month�s victual beforehand. Here is my dagger, dispatch her while she is fat, for if she live but a while longer, she will fallinto a consumption with fretting, and then she will not be worth the eating. Dost thou think that Mahomet will suffer this �Tis like he will, when he cannot let it. Go to, fall to your meat: what not a bit? belike he hath not been watered today, givehimsome drink.They give him water to drink, and he flings it onthe ground  Fast and welcome sir, while hunger makeyou eat. How now zenocrate, doth not theTurk and his wife make a goodly show at a banquet? Yes. my Lord. Methinks, �tis a great deal better than a consort of music. Yet music would do well to cheer up zenocrate: pray thee tell, why artthou so sad? If thou wilt have a song, theTurk shall strain his voice: but why is it? My lord, to see my father�s town besieged, The country wasted where myself was born, How can it but afflictmy very soul? If any love remain in you my Lord, Or if my loveunto your majesty May merit favor at your highness� hands, Then raise your siege from fair Damascus� walls, And with my father take a friendly truce. Zenocrate, wereEgypt Jove�s own land, Yet would I with my sword make Jove to stoop, I willconfute those blind Geographers That make a tripleregion in the world, Excluding Regions which I mean to trace, And with this pen reduce themtoa Map. Calling the Provinces, Cities and towns After my name and thine zenocrate: Hereat Damascus will I make the Point That shall begin the Perpendicular. And wouldst thou have me buy thy Father�s love With such a loss? Tell me zenocrate? Honor still weight on happy tamburlaine: Yet give me leave to plead for himmy Lord. Content thyself, his person shall be safe. And all the friends of fair Zenocrate, If with their lives they will be pleased to yield, Or may be forced to make me Emperor. For Egypt and Arabia must be mine.  Feed you slave, thou may�st think thyself happy to be  fed from my trencher.  My empty stomach full of idle heat,  Draws bloody humors from my feeble parts,  Preserving life, by hasting cruel death.  My veins are pale, my sinews hard and dry,  My joints benumbed, unless I eat, I die.  Eat Bajazeth, Let us live in spite of them,  Looking some happy power will pity and enlarge us.  Here Turk, wilt thou have a clean trencher?  Ay Tyrant, and more meat.  Soft sir, you must be dieted, too much eating  will make you surfeit.  So it would my lord, specially having so small  a walk, and so little exercise.  Enter a second course of CrownsTheridamas, techelles and Casane, here are  the cates you desire to finger, are they not?  Ay (my Lord) but none save kings must feed  with these.  �Tis enough for us to see them, and for tamburlaine  only to enjoy them.  Well, Here is now to the Soldan of Egypt  the King of Arabia, and the Governor of Damascus.  Now take these three crowns, and pledge me, my contributory  Kings.  I crown you here (Theridamas) King of Argier:  Techelles King of Fez, and Usumcasane King of  Moroccus. How say you to this (Turk) these are not  your contributory kings.Nor shall they long be thine, I warrantthem.  Kings of Argier, Moroccus, and of Fez.  You that have marched with happy Tamburlaine,  As far as from thefrozen place of heaven.  Unto the wat�ry morning�s ruddy hour.  And thence by land unto the Torrid Zone,  Deserve these titles I endow you with.  By value and by magnanimity.  Your births shall be no blemish to your fame.  For virtue is the fount whence honor springs.  And theyare worthy she investeth kings.  And since your highness hath so well vouchsafed,  If we deserve them not with higher meeds Then erst our states and actions have retained,  Take them away again and make us slaves.  Well said Theridamas, when holy Fates  Shall �stablish me in strong Egyptia.  We mean to travel to th� Antarctic Pole,  Conquering the people underneath our feet.  And be renowned, as never Emperors were.  zenocrate, I will not crown thee yet,  Until with greater honors I be graced.  Fiinis Actus quarti.Actus: 5. Scaena. 1.

If humble suits or imprecations, (uttered with tears of wretchedness and blood, Shed from the heads and hearts ofall our Sex. Some made your wives, and some your children) Might have entreated your obdurate breasts. To entertainsome care of our securities. Whiles only danger beat upon our walls, These more than dangerous warrants ofour death Had never been erected as they be,Nor you depend on such weak helps as we  Well, lovely Virgins, think our country�s care  Our love of honor loath to beenthralled To foreign powers, and roughimperious yokes: Would not with too much cowardice or fear, Before all hope of rescue were denied, Submit yourselves and us toservitude. Therefore in that your safeties and our own Your honors, libertiesand lives were weighed In equal care and balance with our own, Endure as we the maliceof our stars.The wrath of Tamburlaine, and power of wars. Or be the means the overweighingheavens Have kept to qualify these hot extremes. And bring us pardon in your cheerfullooks. Then here before the majesty of heaven, And holy Patrons of Egyptia, With knees and hearts submissivewe entreat, Grace to our words and pity toour looks That this device mayprove propitious, And through theeyesand ears of tamburlaine, Convey events of mercy to his heart: Grant that these signs of victory we yield May bind the temples of his conquering head, To hide the folded furrows ofhis brows, And shadow his displeased countenance, With happy looks of ruth and lenity, Leave us my Lord, and loving countrymen, What simple Virgins may persuade, we will.

Alas poor fools, must you be first shall feel  The sworn destruction of Damascus.  They know my custom: could theynot as well  Have sent ye out, when first my milk�white flags  Throughwhich sweet mercy threw her gentlebeams  Reflexing them on your disdainful eyes: As now when fury and incensed hate  Flings slaughtering terror from my coal�black tents.  And tells for truth, submissions comes too late.  Most happy King and Emperor of the  earth.  Image of Honor and Nobility.  For whom the Powers divine have made the world.  And on whose throne the holy Graces sit.  In whose sweet person is comprised the Sum  Of nature�s Skill and heavenly majesty.  Pity our plights, O pity poor Damascus:  Pity old age, within whose silver hairs  Honor and reverence evermore have reigned,  Pity the marriage bed, where many a Lord  In prime and glory of his loving joy.  Embraceth now with tears of ruth and blood,  The jealous body of his fearful wife,  Whose cheeks and hearts so punished with conceit, To think thy puissant never�stayed arm Will part their bodies, and prevent their souls From heavens of comfort, yet their age might bear, Now wax all pale and withered tothe death, As well for grief our ruthless Governor Have thus refused the mercy of thy hand, (Whose sceptre Angels kiss, and Furies dread) As for their liberties, their loves orlives, O then for these, and such as we ourselves, Forus, for infants, and for allour bloods, That never nourished thought against thy rule, Pity, O pity, (sacred Emperor) The prostrate service of this wretched town. And take in sign thereof this gilded wreath, Whereto each manof rule hath given his hand, And wished as worthy subjects happy means, To be investers of thy royalbrows, Even with the true Egyptian Diadem. Virgins, in vain ye labor to prevent ]That which minehonorswears shall be performed: Behold my sword, what see you at the point? Nothing but fear and fatal steel my Lord. Your fearful minds are thick and misty then For there sits Death, there sits imperious Death. Keeping his circuitby the slicing edge. But I am pleased you shall not see him there, He now is seated on my horsemen�s spears: And on their points his fleshlessbody feeds. Techelles, straight go charge a few of them To charge these Dames, and showmy servant death: Sitting in scarlet on their armed spears.  O pity us.  Away with them I say and show themdeath. I will not spare these proud Egyptians. Nor change my Martialobservations, For allthe wealth of Gihon�s golden waves. Or for the love of Venus, would she leave The angry God of Arms, and lie with me. They have refused the offer of their lives, And know my customs areas peremptory As wrathful Planets, death, or destiny.Enter Techelles  What, have your horsemen shown the virgins Death? They have my Lord, and on Damascus� walls Have hoist up their slaughtered carcases. A sight as baneful to theirsouls I think As are Thessalian drugs or Mithridate. But go my Lords, put the rest to the sword. Exunt Ah fair Zenocrate, divine Zenocrate, Fair is too foul an Epithet for thee, That in thy passion for thy country�s love, And fear to see thy kinglyFather�s harm, With hair disheveled wip�st thy watery cheeks: And like to Flora in her morning�s pride, Shaking her silver tresses in the air. Rain�st on theearth resolved pearl in showers, And sprinklest sapphires on thy shining face, Where Beauty, mother to the Muses sits, And commentsvolumes with her Ivory pen: Taking instructions from thy flowing eyes, Eyes when that Ebena steps to heaven. In silence of thy solemn Evening�s walk. Making the mantle of the richest night. The Moon, the Planets, and the Meteors light,  There Angels in their crystal armors fight  A doubtful battle with my tempted thoughts,  For Egypt�s freedom and the Soldan�s life:  His life that so consumes Zenocrate,  Whose sorrows lay more siege unto my soul,  Than all my Army to Damascus� walls.  And neither Persians Sovereign, nor the Turk  Troubled my senses with conceit of foil,  So much by much, as doth zenocrate.   hat is beauty saith my sufferings then? If all thepens that ever poets held, Had fed the feeling of theirmaster�s thoughts, And every sweetness that inspired their hearts, Their minds, and muses on admired themes: If all theheavenly Quintessence they still From theirimmortal flowers of Poesy, Wherein as in a mirror we perceive The highest reaches of a human wit. If these had made one Poem�s period And all combined in Beauty�s worthiness, Yet should there hover in their restless heads, One thought, one grace, one wonder at the least, Which into words no virtue can digest: But how unseemly is it for my Sex My discipline of arms and Chivalry, My nature and the terror of my name. To harbor thoughts effeminate and faint? Save only that inBeauty�s just applause, With whose instinct the soul of man is touched. And every warrior that is rapt with love, Of fame, of valor, and of victoryMust needs have beauty beat on his conceits, I thus conceiving and subduing both: That which hath stopped the tempest of the Gods, Even from the fiery spangled veil of heaven, To feel the lovely warmth of shepherds� flames, And march in cottages of strewed weeds, Shall give theworld to note for all my birth, ThatVirtue solely is the sum of glory, And fashions men with true nobility.

No more there is not I warrant thee techelles We know the victory is ours my Lord,   But let us save the reverend Soldan�s life,   For fair Zenocrate, that so laments his state.  That will we chiefly see unto, theridamas.  For sweet zenocrate, whose worthiness  Deserves a conquest over every heart:   And now my footstool, if I losethe field, You hope of liberty and restitution: Here let him stay my masters from the tents, Till we have made us ready for the field. Pray for us Bajazeth, we are going.  Go, never to return with victory: Millions of men encompass thee about. And gore thy body with as many wounds, Sharp forked arrows light upon thy horse: Furies from the black Cocytus� lake, Break up the earth, and with their firebrands, Enforce thee run upon the baneful pikes. Volleys ofshot piercethrough thy charmed Skin. And every bullet dipped in poisoneddrugs, Or roaring Cannons sever all thy joints. Making thee mount as high as Eagles soar. Let all the swords and Lances in the field, Stick in his breast, asin their proper rooms, At every pore let blood come dropping forth. That ling�ring pains may massacre his heart. And madness send his damned soul to hell. Ah fair zabina, we may curse his power, The heavensmay frown, the earth for anger quake, But such a Star hathinfluence in his sword, As rules the Skies, and countermands the Gods. More than Cimmerian Styx or Destiny: And thenshall we in this detested guise, With shame, with hunger, and with horror aye Griping our bowels with retorqued thoughts, And have no hope to end our ecstasies. Then is there leftno Mahomet, no God, No Fiend, no Fortune, nor no hope of end? To our infamous monstrous slaveries:  Gape earth, and let the Fiend�s infernal view,  As hell, as hopeless and as full of fear  As are the blasted banks of Erebus:  Where shaking ghosts with ever howling groans,  Hover about the ugly Ferryman, to get a passage to Elysian  why should we live, O wretches, beggars slaves Why live we Bajazeth, and build up nests, So high within the region of the air, By living long in this oppression, That all the world will see and laugh to scorn. The former triumphs ofour mightiness, In this obscure infernal servitude? O life more loathsome to my vexed thoughts, Than noisome parbreak of the Stygian Snakes, Which fills the nooks ofHell with standing air, Infecting all the Ghosts with cureless griefs: O dreary Engines of my loathed sight, That sees my crown, my honor and my name, Thrust under yoke and thraldom ofa thief. Why feed ye still on day�s accursed beams, And sinknot quite into my tortured soul. You see my wife, my Queen and Empress, Brought up and propped by thehand of fame, Queen of fifteen contributory Queens, Now thrown to rooms of black abjection, Smeared with blots of basest drudgery: And Villeiness to shame, disdain, and misery: Accursed Bajazeth, whose words of ruth, Thatwould with pity cheer Zabina�s heart: And make our souls resolve in ceaseless tears, Sharp hunger bites upon and gripes theroot:From whence the issues of my thoughts do break, O poor zabina, O my Queen, my Queen, Fetch mesome water for my burning breast, To cool and comfort me with longer date, That in the short�ned sequel of my life, I may pour forth my soul into thinearms, With words oflove: whose moaning intercourse Hath hitherto been stayed, with wrath and hate Of our expressless banned inflictions inflictions: Sweet Bajazeth, I will prolong thy life, As long as any blood or spark of breath Can quench or cool the torments of my grief. She goes out. Now Bajazeth, abridgethy baneful days, And beat thy brains out ofthy conqueredhead: Since other means are all forbidden me, That may beministers of my decay. O highest Lamp of everliving Jove, Accursed day infected with my griefs, Hidenow thy stained face in endless night, And shut the windows of the lightsome heavens, Let ugly darkness with her rusty coach Engirt with tempests wrapped in pitchy clouds, Smother the earth with never�fading mists:  And let her horses from their nostrils breathe  Rebellious winds and dreadful thunderclaps:  That in this terror tamburlaine may live.  And my pined soul resolved in liquid ay,  May still excruciate his tormented thoughts.  Then let the stony dart of senseless cold,  Pierce through the center of my withered heart,  And make a passage for my loathed life.  He brains himself against the cage.Enter Zabina What do mine eyes behold, my husband dead? His Skull allrivenintwain, his brains dashed out? The brains of Bajazeth, my Lord and Sovereign? O Bajazeth, my husband and my Lord, O Bajazeth, OTurk, O Emperor, give him his liquor Not I, bring milkand fire, and my blood I bring him again, tear me in pieces, giveme the sword with a ball of wildfireupon it. Down with him, down with him. Go to my child, away, away, away. Ah, save that Infant, save him, save him. I, even I speak to her, the Sun was down. Streamers white. Red, Black, here here, here.

She runs against the Cage and brains herself Zenocrate with Anippe,Wretched Zenocrate, that livest to see, Damascus� walls dyed with Egyptian blood. Thy Father�s subjects and thy countrymen: Thy streets strewed with dissevered joints of men, And wounded bodies gasping yet for life. But most accursed, tosee the Sun�bright troop Of heavenly virgins and unspotted maids, Whose looks might makethe angry God of arms, To break his sword, and mildly treat oflove, On horsemen�s Lances to be hoisted up, And guiltlessly endure a crueldeath. For every fell and stout Tartarian Stead, That stamped on others with their thund�ring hooves  When all their riders charged their quivering spears  Began to check the ground, and rein themselves: Gazing upon the beauty of their looks: Ah Tamburlaine, wert thou the cause of this That term�st Zenocrate thy dearest love? Whose lives were dearer to Zenocrate Than her own life, or aught save thine own love. But see another bloody spectacle. Ah wretched eyes, theenemies of my heart, How are ye glutted with these grievous objects, And tell my soul more tales of bleeding ruth? See, see Anippe if they breathe or no.No breath nor sense, nor motion in them both Ah Madam, this their slavery hath Enforced, And ruthless cruelty of Tamburlaine. Earthcast up fountainsfrom thy entrails, And wet thy cheeks for their untimely deaths: Shake with their weight in sign of fear and grief: Blush heaven, that gave them honor at their birth, And let them die a death so barbarous. Those that are proud of fickleEmpery, And place their chiefest good in earthly pomp: Behold the Turk and his great Emperesse. Ah tamburlaine, my love, sweet tamburlaine, That fights for Sceptres and for slippery crowns, Behold the Turk and his great Emperesse, Thou that in conductof thy happy stars, Sleep�st every night with conquest on thy brows, And yet wouldst shun the wavering turns of war, In fear and feeling of the like distress, Behold the Turk and his great Emperesse. Ah mighty Jove and holy Mahomet, Pardon my Love, oh pardon his contempt, Of earthly fortune, and respect of pity, And let not conquest ruthlessly pursued Be equally against his life incensed, In this great Turk and hapless Emperesse. And pardonme that was not moved with ruth, To see themlive so long in misery: Ah what may chance to thee zenocrate? Madam content yourself and beresolved, Your Love hath fortuneso at his command, That she shall stay and turn her wheel no more, As long as life maintains his mighty arm, That fights for honor to adorn your head. Enter a messengerWhat other heavy news now brings Philemus? Madam, your father and th�Arabian king, The firstaffecter ofyour excellence, Comes now as Turnus �gainst Aeneas did. Armed with lance into the Egyptian fields, Ready for battle �gainst my Lord the King. Now shame and duty, love and fear presents A thousand sorrows to my martyred soul: Whom should I wish the fatal victory, When my poor pleasures are divided thus, And racked by duty from my cursed heart: My father and my first betrothed love, Must fight against my life and present love: Wherein the change I use condemns my faith, And makes my deeds infamousthrough the world. But as the Gods to end the Trojans� toil, Prevented Turnus of Lavinia. And fatally enriched Aeneas� love. So for a finalIssue tomy griefs,To pacify my country and my love, Must Tamburlaine by their resistless powers, With virtue of a gentlevictory, Conclude a league of honor to my hope, Then as the powers divine have preordained, With happy safety of my father�s life, Send like defense of fair Arabia. They sound to the battle.And Tamburlaine enjoys the victory, after Arabiaenters woundedWhat cursed power guides the murdering hands, Of this infamous Tyrant�s soldiers. That no escape may save their enemies: Nor fortune keep themselves from victory. Lie down Arabia, wounded to the death, And let Zenocrate�s fair eyes behold That as for her thou bear�st these wretched arms. Even so for her thou diest in these arms: Leaving thy blood for witness of thy love. Too dear a witness for such love my Lord, Behold Zenocrate, the cursed object Whose Fortunes never mastered her griefs: Behold her wounded in conceit for thee, As much as thy fair body is for me. Then shall I die with full contented heart, Having beheld divine Zenocrate, Whose sight with joy would take away my life, As now it bringeth sweetness to my wound, If I had not been wounded as I am.Ah that the deadly pangs I suffer now, Would lendan hour�s license to my tongue: To make discourse of some sweet accidents Have chanced thy merits in this worthless bondage. And that I might be privy to the state, Of thy deserved contentment and thy love: But making now a virtue ofthy sight, To drive allsorrow from my fainting soul: Since Death denies mefurther cause of joy. Deprived of care, my heart with comfort dies. Since thy desired hand shall close mine eyes. Enter Tamburlaine leading the Soldan, Techelles,Theridamas, Usumcasane, with othersCome happy Father of Zenocrate, A title higher thanthy Soldan�s name: Though my right hand have thus enthralled thee Thy princely daughter here shall set thee free. She that hath calmed the fury of my sword. Which had ere this been bathed in streams of blood, As vast and deepas Euphrates or Nile. O sight thrice welcome to my joyful soul. To see theking my Father issue safe, From dangerous battle of my conquering Love. Well met my onlydear Zenocrate, Though with the loss of Egypt and my Crown. �Twas I my lordthat gat the victory, And therefore grieve not at your overthrow. Since I shall render all into your hands. And add more strength to your dominions Then ever yet confirmed th� Egyptian Crown.    The God of war resigns his room to me, Meaning to make me General of the world, Jove viewing me in arms, looks pale and wan, Fearing my power should pull him from his throne, Where�er I comethe fatal sisters sweat, And grisly death by running to and fro, To do their ceaseless homage to my sword: And here in Afric where it seldom rains, Since I arrived with my triumphant host, Have swelling clouds drawn fromwide gasping wounds. Been oft resolved in bloody purple showers, A meteor that might terrify theearth, And make it quake at every drop it drinks: Millions of souls siton the banks of Styx, Waiting the back return of Charon�s boat, Hell and Elysian swarm with ghosts of men, That I have sent from sundry foughten fields. To spread my famethrough hell and up toheaven: And see my Lord, a sight of strange import, Emperors and kings lie breathless at my feet, The Turk and his great Empress as it seems, Left to themselves while we were at the fight. Have desperately dispatched their slavish lives: With them Arabia too hath left his life, All sights of power to grace my victory: And such are objects fit for Tamburlaine. Wherein as in a mirror may be seen, His honor, that consists in shedding blood, When men presume to manage arms with him. Mighty hath God and Mahomet made thy hand (Renowned tamburlaine) to whom all kings  Of force must yield their crowns and Emperies, And I am pleased with this my overthrow: If as beseems a person of thy state, Thou hast with honor used Zenocrate. Her state and person wants no pomp you see, And for all blot offoul inchastity, I record heaven, her heavenly self isclear: Then let me find no further time to grace Her princely Temples with the Persian crown: But here these kings that on my fortunes wait: And have been crowned for proved worthiness, Even by this hand that shall establish them, Shall now, adjoining all their hands with mine, Invest her here my Queen of Persia, What saith the noble Soldan and Zenocrate? I yield with thanks and protestations Of endless honor to thee for her love.Then doubt I not but fair Zenocrate Will soon consent to satisfy us both. Else should I much forget myself, my Lord, Then let us set the crown upon her head, That long hath lingeredfor so high a seat. My hand is ready to perform the deed, For now her marriage time shall work us rest: And here�s the crown my Lord, help set it on Then sit thou down divine Zenocrate, And here we crown thee Queen of Persia, And all the kingdoms and dominions That late the power of Tamburlaine subdued: As Juno, when theGiants were suppressed, That darted mountains at her brother Jove: So looks my Love, shadowing in her brows Triumphs and Trophies for my victories:  Or as Latona�s daughter bent to arms,  Adding more courage to my conquering mind,  To gratify the sweet zenocrate,  Egyptians, Moors and men of Asia,  From Barbary unto the Western Indie,  Shall pay a yearly tribute to thy Sire.  And from the bounds of Afric to the banks  Of Ganges, shall his mighty arm extend.  And now my Lords and loving followers,  That purchased kingdoms by your martial deeds,  Cast off your armor, put on scarlet robes.  Mount up your royal places of estate,  Environed with troops of noble men,  And there make laws to rule your provinces:  Hang up your weapons on Alcides� post,  For Tamburlaine takes truce with all the world.  Thy first betrothed, Love Arabia,  Shall we with honor (as beseems) entomb,  With this great Turk and his fair Emperesse:  Then after all these solemn Exequies,    We will our celebrated rites of marriage solemnize.Finis Actus quinti et ultimi huius  primae partis.
