ACT ISCENE I. London. The palace.Flourish of trumpets: then hautboys. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and CARDINAL, on the one side; QUEEN MARGARET, SUFFOLK, YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other As by your high imperial majestyI had in charge at my depart for France,As procurator to your excellence,To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,I have perform'd my task and was espoused:And humbly now upon my bended knee,In sight of England and her lordly peers,Deliver up my title in the queenTo your most gracious hands, that are the substanceOf that great shadow I did represent;The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,The fairest queen that ever king received.Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:I can express no kinder sign of loveThan this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!For thou hast given me in this beauteous faceA world of earthly blessings to my soul,If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.Great King of England and my gracious lord,The mutual conference that my mind hath had,By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,In courtly company or at my beads,With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,Makes me the bolder to salute my kingWith ruder terms, such as my wit affordsAnd over-joy of heart doth minister.Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;Such is the fulness of my heart's content.Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.[Kneeling] Long live Queen Margaret, England'shappiness!We thank you all.FlourishMy lord protector, so it please your grace,Here are the articles of contracted peaceBetween our sovereign and the French king Charles,For eighteen months concluded by consent.[Reads] 'Imprimis, it is agreed between the Frenchking Charles, and William de la Pole, Marquess ofSuffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, thatthe said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia andJerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere thethirtieth of May next ensuing. Item, that the duchyof Anjou and the county of Maine shall be releasedand delivered to the king her father'--Lets the paper fallUncle, how now!Pardon me, gracious lord;Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heartAnd dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.[Reads] 'Item, It is further agreed between them,that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall bereleased and delivered over to the king her father,and she sent over of the King of England's ownproper cost and charges, without having any dowry.'They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,We here discharge your grace from being regentI' the parts of France, till term of eighteen monthsBe full expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester,Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,Salisbury, and Warwick;We thank you all for the great favour done,In entertainment to my princely queen.Come, let us in, and with all speed provideTo see her coronation be perform'd.Exeunt KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SUFFOLKBrave peers of England, pillars of the state,To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,Your grief, the common grief of all the land.What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,His valour, coin and people, in the wars?Did he so often lodge in open field,In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,To conquer France, his true inheritance?And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,To keep by policy what Henry got?Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,Received deep scars in France and Normandy?Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,With all the learned council of the realm,Studied so long, sat in the council-houseEarly and late, debating to and froHow France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,And had his highness in his infancyCrowned in Paris in despite of foes?And shall these labours and these honours die?Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?O peers of England, shameful is this league!Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,Blotting your names from books of memory,Razing the characters of your renown,Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,Undoing all, as all had never been!Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,This peroration with such circumstance?For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;But now it is impossible we should:Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,Hath given the duchy of Anjou and MaineUnto the poor King Reignier, whose large styleAgrees not with the leanness of his purse.Now, by the death of Him that died for all,These counties were the keys of Normandy.But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?For grief that they are past recovery:For, were there hope to conquer them again,My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:And are the cities, that I got with wounds,Delivered up again with peaceful words?Mort Dieu!For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,That dims the honour of this warlike isle!France should have torn and rent my very heart,Before I would have yielded to this league.I never read but England's kings have hadLarge sums of gold and dowries with their wives:And our King Henry gives away his own,To match with her that brings no vantages.A proper jest, and never heard before,That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenthFor costs and charges in transporting her!She should have stayed in France and starvedin France, Before--My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:It was the pleasure of my lord the King.My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy faceI see thy fury: if I longer stay,We shall begin our ancient bickerings.Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,I prophesied France will be lost ere long.ExitSo, there goes our protector in a rage.'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,And heir apparent to the English crown:Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,There's reason he should be displeased at it.Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing wordsBewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.What though the common people favour him,Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke ofGloucester,'Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,He will be found a dangerous protector.Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,He being of age to govern of himself?Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.This weighty business will not brook delay:I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.ExitCousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's prideAnd greatness of his place be grief to us,Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:His insolence is more intolerableThan all the princes in the land beside:If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSETPride went before, ambition follows him.While these do labour for their own preferment,Behoves it us to labour for the realm.I never saw but Humphrey Duke of GloucesterDid bear him like a noble gentleman.Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,More like a soldier than a man o' the church,As stout and proud as he were lord of all,Swear like a ruffian and demean himselfUnlike the ruler of a commonweal.Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,In bringing them to civil discipline,Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,When thou wert regent for our sovereign,Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:Join we together, for the public good,In what we can, to bridle and suppressThe pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,While they do tend the profit of the land.So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,And common profit of his country![Aside] And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,And would have kept so long as breath did last!Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,Which I will win from France, or else be slain,Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURYAnjou and Maine are given to the French;Paris is lost; the state of NormandyStands on a tickle point, now they are gone:Suffolk concluded on the articles,The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleasedTo change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillageAnd purchase friends and give to courtezans,Still revelling like lords till all be gone;While as the silly owner of the goodsWeeps over them and wrings his hapless handsAnd shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,While all is shared and all is borne away,Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.Methinks the realms of England, France and IrelandBear that proportion to my flesh and bloodAs did the fatal brand Althaea burn'dUnto the prince's heart of Calydon.Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,Even as I have of fertile England's soil.A day will come when York shall claim his own;And therefore I will take the Nevils' partsAnd make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,Nor wear the diadem upon his head,Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,To pry into the secrets of the state;Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;And in my standard bear the arms of YorkTo grapple with the house of Lancaster;And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.ExitSCENE II. GLOUCESTER'S house.Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,As frowning at the favours of the world?Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,Enchased with all the honours of the world?If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,Until thy head be circled with the same.Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:And, having both together heaved it up,We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,And never more abase our sight so lowAs to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.And may that thought, when I imagine illAgainst my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,Be my last breathing in this mortal world!My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite itWith sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;And on the pieces of the broken wandWere placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.Tut, this was nothing but an argumentThat he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's groveShall lose his head for his presumption.But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:Methought I sat in seat of majestyIn the cathedral church of Westminster,And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to meAnd on my head did set the diadem.Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,Art thou not second woman in the realm,And the protector's wife, beloved of him?Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,Above the reach or compass of thy thought?And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,To tumble down thy husband and thyselfFrom top of honour to disgrace's feet?Away from me, and let me hear no more!What, what, my lord! are you so cholericWith Eleanor, for telling but her dream?Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,And not be cheque'd.Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.Enter MessengerMy lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasureYou do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.Exeunt GLOUCESTER and MessengerFollow I must; I cannot go before,While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocksAnd smooth my way upon their headless necks;And, being a woman, I will not be slackTo play my part in Fortune's pageant.Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,We are alone; here's none but thee and I.Enter HUMEJesus preserve your royal majesty!What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,Your grace's title shall be multiplied.What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'dWith Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?And will they undertake to do me good?This they have promised, to show your highnessA spirit raised from depth of under-ground,That shall make answer to such questionsAs by your grace shall be propounded him.It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:When from St. Alban's we do make return,We'll see these things effected to the full.Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,With thy confederates in this weighty cause.ExitHume must make merry with the duchess' gold;Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:The business asketh silent secrecy.Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.Yet have I gold flies from another coast;I dare not say, from the rich cardinalAnd from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,Have hired me to undermine the duchessAnd buz these conjurations in her brain.They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go nearTo call them both a pair of crafty knaves.Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at lastHume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.ExitSCENE III. The palace.Enter three or four Petitioners, PETER, the Armourer's man, being one My masters, let's stand close: my lord protectorwill come this way by and by, and then we may deliverour supplications in the quill.Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man!Jesu bless him!Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN MARGARETHere a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him.I'll be the first, sure.Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk, andnot my lord protector.How now, fellow! would'st anything with me?I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my lordprotector.[Reading] 'To my Lord Protector!' Are yoursupplications to his lordship? Let me see them:what is thine?Mine is, an't please your grace, against JohnGoodman, my lord cardinal's man, for keeping myhouse, and lands, and wife and all, from me.Thy wife, too! that's some wrong, indeed. What'syours? What's here!Reads'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing thecommons of Melford.' How now, sir knave!Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.[Giving his petition] Against my master, ThomasHorner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightfulheir to the crown.What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he wasrightful heir to the crown?That my master was? no, forsooth: my master saidthat he was, and that the king was an usurper.Who is there?Enter ServantTake this fellow in, and send forhis master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hearmore of your matter before the King.Exit Servant with PETERAnd as for you, that love to be protectedUnder the wings of our protector's grace,Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.Tears the supplicationAway, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.Come, let's be gone.ExeuntMy Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,Is this the fashion in the court of England?Is this the government of Britain's isle,And this the royalty of Albion's king?What shall King Henry be a pupil stillUnder the surly Gloucester's governance?Am I a queen in title and in style,And must be made a subject to a duke?I tell thee, Pole, when in the city ToursThou ran'st a tilt in honour of my loveAnd stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,I thought King Henry had resembled theeIn courage, courtship and proportion:But all his mind is bent to holiness,To number Ave-Maries on his beads;His champions are the prophets and apostles,His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,His study is his tilt-yard, and his lovesAre brazen images of canonized saints.I would the college of the cardinalsWould choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,And set the triple crown upon his head:That were a state fit for his holiness.Madam, be patient: as I was causeYour highness came to England, so will IIn England work your grace's full content.Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,And grumbling York: and not the least of theseBut can do more in England than the king.And he of these that can do most of allCannot do more in England than the Nevils:Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.Not all these lords do vex me half so muchAs that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:Strangers in court do take her for the queen:She bears a duke's revenues on her back,And in her heart she scorns our poverty:Shall I not live to be avenged on her?Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,The very train of her worst wearing gownWas better worth than all my father's lands,Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,And placed a quire of such enticing birds,That she will light to listen to the lays,And never mount to trouble you again.So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;For I am bold to counsel you in this.Although we fancy not the cardinal,Yet must we join with him and with the lords,Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.As for the Duke of York, this late complaintWill make but little for his benefit.So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, CARDINAL, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and the DUCHESSFor my part, noble lords, I care not which;Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.If York have ill demean'd himself in France,Then let him be denay'd the regentship.If Somerset be unworthy of the place,Let York be regent; I will yield to him.Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,Dispute not that: York is the worthier.Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.The cardinal's not my better in the field.All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.Warwick may live to be the best of all.Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,Why Somerset should be preferred in this.Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.Madam, the king is old enough himselfTo give his censure: these are no women's matters.If he be old enough, what needs your graceTo be protector of his excellence?Madam, I am protector of the realm;And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.Resign it then and leave thine insolence.Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;And all the peers and nobles of the realmHave been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bagsAre lank and lean with thy extortions.Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attireHave cost a mass of public treasury.Thy cruelty in executionUpon offenders, hath exceeded law,And left thee to the mercy of the law.They sale of offices and towns in France,If they were known, as the suspect is great,Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fanGive me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?She gives the DUCHESS a box on the earI cry you mercy, madam; was it you?Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:Could I come near your beauty with my nails,I'd set my ten commandments in your face.Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.Against her will! good king, look to't in time;She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:Though in this place most master wear no breeches,She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.ExitLord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.ExitRe-enter GLOUCESTERNow, lords, my choler being over-blownWith walking once about the quadrangle,I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.As for your spiteful false objections,Prove them, and I lie open to the law:But God in mercy so deal with my soul,As I in duty love my king and country!But, to the matter that we have in hand:I say, my sovereign, York is meetest manTo be your regent in the realm of France.Before we make election, give me leaveTo show some reason, of no little force,That York is most unmeet of any man.I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;Next, if I be appointed for the place,My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,Without discharge, money, or furniture,Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:Last time, I danced attendance on his willTill Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.That can I witness; and a fouler factDid never traitor in the land commit.Peace, headstrong Warwick!Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guardedBecause here is a man accused of treason:Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?Please it your majesty, this is the manThat doth accuse his master of high treason:His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,Was rightful heir unto the English crownAnd that your majesty was a usurper.Say, man, were these thy words?An't shall please your majesty, I never said northought any such matter: God is my witness, I amfalsely accused by the villain.By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them tome in the garret one night, as we were scouring myLord of York's armour.Base dunghill villain and mechanical,I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.I do beseech your royal majesty,Let him have all the rigor of the law.Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correcthim for his fault the other day, he did vow upon hisknees he would be even with me: I have goodwitness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,do not cast away an honest man for a villain'saccusation.Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?This doom, my lord, if I may judge:Let Somerset be regent over the French,Because in York this breeds suspicion:And let these have a day appointed themFor single combat in convenient place,For he hath witness of his servant's malice:This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.I humbly thank your royal majesty.And I accept the combat willingly.Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pitymy case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. OLord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able tofight a blow. O Lord, my heart!Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.Away with them to prison; and the day of combatshall be the last of the next month. Come,Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.Flourish.

ExeuntSCENE II. London. YORK'S garden.Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,Our simple supper ended, give me leaveIn this close walk to satisfy myself,In craving your opinion of my title,Which is infallible, to England's crown.My lord, I long to hear it at full.Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,The Nevils are thy subjects to command.Then thus:Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whomWas John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;William of Windsor was the seventh and last.Edward the Black Prince died before his fatherAnd left behind him Richard, his only son,Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.Father, the duke hath told the truth:Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.Which now they hold by force and not by right;For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,The issue of the next son should have reign'd.But William of Hatfield died without an heir.The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose lineI claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,Who kept him in captivity till he died.But to the rest.His eldest sister, Anne,My mother, being heir unto the crownMarried Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was sonTo Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.By her I claim the kingdom: she was heirTo Roger Earl of March, who was the sonOf Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:So, if the issue of the elder sonSucceed before the younger, I am king.What plain proceeding is more plain than this?Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,The fourth son; York claims it from the third.Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:It fails not yet, but flourishes in theeAnd in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;And in this private plot be we the firstThat shall salute our rightful sovereignWith honour of his birthright to the crown.Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!We thank you, lords. But I am not your kingTill I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'dWith heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,But with advice and silent secrecy.Do you as I do in these dangerous days:Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,At Buckingham and all the crew of them,Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking thatShall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.My heart assures me that the Earl of WarwickShall one day make the Duke of York a king.And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:Richard shall live to make the Earl of WarwickThe greatest man in England but the king.ExeuntSCENE III.

I think she comes; and I'll prepareMy tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper burning in her hand; with STANLEY, the Sheriff, and OfficersSo please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.No, stir not, for your lives; let her pass by.Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!See how the giddy multitude do point,And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!For whilst I think I am thy married wifeAnd thou a prince, protector of this land,Methinks I should not thus be led along,Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,And followed with a rabble that rejoiceTo see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,And when I start, the envious people laughAnd bid me be advised how I tread.Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?No; dark shall be my light and night my day;To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,And he a prince and ruler of the land:Yet so he ruled and such a prince he wasAs he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,Was made a wonder and a pointing-stockTo every idle rascal follower.But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,Nor stir at nothing till the axe of deathHang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;For Suffolk, he that can do all in allWith her that hateth thee and hates us all,And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;I must offend before I be attainted;And had I twenty times so many foes,And each of them had twenty times their power,All these could not procure me any scathe,So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped awayBut I in danger for the breach of law.Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience;These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.Enter a HeraldI summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,Holden at Bury the first of this next month.And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.Exit HeraldMy Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.An't please your grace, here my commission stays,And Sir John Stanley is appointed nowTo take her with him to the Isle of Man.Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?So am I given in charge, may't please your grace.Entreat her not the worse in that I prayYou use her well: the world may laugh again;And I may live to do you kindness ifYou do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.Exeunt GLOUCESTER and ServingmenArt thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!For none abides with me: my joy is death;Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,Because I wish'd this world's eternity.Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence;I care not whither, for I beg no favour,Only convey me where thou art commanded.Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man;There to be used according to your state.That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:And shall I then be used reproachfully?Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady;According to that state you shall be used.Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.Come, Stanley, shall we go?Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,And go we to attire you for our journey.My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:No, it will hang upon my richest robesAnd show itself, attire me how I can.Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.Can you not see? or will ye not observeThe strangeness of his alter'd countenance?With what a majesty he bears himself,How insolent of late he is become,How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?We know the time since he was mild and affable,And if we did but glance a far-off look,Immediately he was upon his knee,That all the court admired him for submission:But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,When every one will give the time of day,He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,Disdaining duty that to us belongs.Small curs are not regarded when they grin;But great men tremble when the lion roars;And Humphrey is no little man in England.First note that he is near you in descent,And should you fall, he as the next will mount.Me seemeth then it is no policy,Respecting what a rancorous mind he bearsAnd his advantage following your decease,That he should come about your royal personOr be admitted to your highness' council.By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,And when he please to make commotion,'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the gardenAnd choke the herbs for want of husbandry.The reverent care I bear unto my lordMade me collect these dangers in the duke.If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;Which fear if better reasons can supplant,I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,Reprove my allegation, if you can;Or else conclude my words effectual.Well hath your highness seen into this duke;And, had I first been put to speak my mind,I think I should have told your grace's tale.The duchess, by his subornation,Upon my life, began her devilish practises:Or, if he were not privy to those faults,Yet, by reputing of his high descent,As next the king he was successive heir,And such high vaunts of his nobility,Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchessBy wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;And in his simple show he harbours treason.The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a manUnsounded yet and full of deep deceit.Did he not, contrary to form of law,Devise strange deaths for small offences done?And did he not, in his protectorship,Levy great sums of money through the realmFor soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?By means whereof the towns each day revolted.Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.Which time will bring to light in smoothDuke Humphrey.My lords, at once: the care you have of us,To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocentFrom meaning treason to our royal personAs is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:The duke is virtuous, mild and too well givenTo dream on evil or to work my downfall.Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,For he's disposed as the hateful raven:Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us allHangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.Enter SOMERSETAll health unto my gracious sovereign!Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?That all your interest in those territoriesIs utterly bereft you; all is lost.Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done![Aside] Cold news for me; for I had hope of FranceAs firmly as I hope for fertile England.Thus are my blossoms blasted in the budAnd caterpillars eat my leaves away;But I will remedy this gear ere long,Or sell my title for a glorious grave.Enter GLOUCESTERAll happiness unto my lord the king!Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:I do arrest thee of high treason here.Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blushNor change my countenance for this arrest:A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.The purest spring is not so free from mudAs I am clear from treason to my sovereign:Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;By means whereof his highness hath lost France.Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,Or any groat I hoarded to my use,Be brought against me at my trial-day!No; many a pound of mine own proper store,Because I would not tax the needy commons,Have I disbursed to the garrisons,And never ask'd for restitution.It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.I say no more than truth, so help me God!In your protectorship you did deviseStrange tortures for offenders never heard of,That England was defamed by tyranny.Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I wasprotector,Pity was all the fault that was in me;For I should melt at an offender's tears,And lowly words were ransom for their fault.Unless it were a bloody murderer,Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,I never gave them condign punishment:Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I torturedAbove the felon or what trespass else.My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.I do arrest you in his highness' name;And here commit you to my lord cardinalTo keep, until your further time of trial.My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hopeThat you will clear yourself from all suspect:My conscience tells me you are innocent.Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:Virtue is choked with foul ambitionAnd charity chased hence by rancour's hand;Foul subornation is predominantAnd equity exiled your highness' land.I know their complot is to have my life,And if my death might make this island happy,And prove the period of their tyranny,I would expend it with all willingness:But mine is made the prologue to their play;For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongueThe envious load that lies upon his heart;And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,By false accuse doth level at my life:And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,And with your best endeavour have stirr'd upMy liefest liege to be mine enemy:Ay, all you have laid your heads together--Myself had notice of your conventicles--And all to make away my guiltless life.I shall not want false witness to condemn me,Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;The ancient proverb will be well effected:'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'My liege, his railing is intolerable:If those that care to keep your royal personFrom treason's secret knife and traitors' rageBe thus upbraided, chid and rated at,And the offender granted scope of speech,'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.Hath he not twit our sovereign lady hereWith ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,As if she had suborned some to swearFalse allegations to o'erthrow his state?But I can give the loser leave to chide.Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!And well such losers may have leave to speak.He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutchBefore his legs be firm to bear his body.Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.Exit, guardedMy lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,Do or undo, as if ourself were here.What, will your highness leave the parliament?Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,My body round engirt with misery,For what's more miserable than discontent?Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I seeThe map of honour, truth and loyalty:And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to comeThat e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.What louring star now envies thy estate,That these great lords and Margaret our queenDo seek subversion of thy harmless life?Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;And as the butcher takes away the calfAnd binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;And as the dam runs lowing up and down,Looking the way her harmless young one went,And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's caseWith sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyesLook after him and cannot do him good,So mighty are his vowed enemies.His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groanSay 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, and YORK; SOMERSET remains apartFree lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's showBeguiles him as the mournful crocodileWith sorrow snares relenting passengers,Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a childThat for the beauty thinks it excellent.Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,To rid us of the fear we have of him.That he should die is worthy policy;But yet we want a colour for his death:'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.But, in my mind, that were no policy:The king will labour still to save his life,The commons haply rise, to save his life;And yet we have but trivial argument,More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.So that, by this, you would not have him die.Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,Were't not all one, an empty eagle were setTo guard the chicken from a hungry kite,As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?So the poor chicken should be sure of death.Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,To make the fox surveyor of the fold?Who being accused a crafty murderer,His guilt should be but idly posted over,Because his purpose is not executed.No; let him die, in that he is a fox,By nature proved an enemy to the flock,Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,So he be dead; for that is good deceitWhich mates him first that first intends deceit.Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.Not resolute, except so much were done;For things are often spoke and seldom meant:But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,Seeing the deed is meritorious,And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,Say but the word, and I will be his priest.But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,Ere you can take due orders for a priest:Say you consent and censure well the deed,And I'll provide his executioner,I tender so the safety of my liege.Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.And so say I.And I and now we three have spoke it,It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.Enter a PostGreat lords, from Ireland am I come amain,To signify that rebels there are upAnd put the Englishmen unto the sword:Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,Before the wound do grow uncurable;For, being green, there is great hope of help.A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!What counsel give you in this weighty cause?That Somerset be sent as regent thither:'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;Witness the fortune he hath had in France.If York, with all his far-fet policy,Had been the regent there instead of me,He never would have stay'd in France so long.No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:I rather would have lost my life betimesThan bring a burthen of dishonour homeBy staying there so long till all were lost.Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,Might happily have proved far worse than his.What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in armsAnd temper clay with blood of Englishmen:To Ireland will you lead a band of men,Collected choicely, from each county some,And try your hap against the Irishmen?I will, my lord, so please his majesty.Why, our authority is his consent,And what we do establish he confirms:Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.No more of him; for I will deal with himThat henceforth he shall trouble us no more.And so break off; the day is almost spent:Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen daysAt Bristol I expect my soldiers;For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.Exeunt all but YORKNow, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,And change misdoubt to resolution:Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou artResign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,And find no harbour in a royal heart.Faster than spring-time showers comes thoughton thought,And not a thought but thinks on dignity.My brain more busy than the labouring spiderWeaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,To send me packing with an host of men:I fear me you but warm the starved snake,Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will stingyour hearts.'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:I take it kindly; and yet be well assuredYou put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,I will stir up in England some black stormShall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;And this fell tempest shall not cease to rageUntil the golden circuit on my head,Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.And, for a minister of my intent,I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,John Cade of Ashford,To make commotion, as full well he can,Under the title of John Mortimer.In Ireland have I seen this stubborn CadeOppose himself against a troop of kerns,And fought so long, till that his thighs with dartsWere almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;And, in the end being rescued, I have seenHim caper upright like a wild Morisco,Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,Hath he conversed with the enemy,And undiscover'd come to me againAnd given me notice of their villanies.This devil here shall be my substitute;For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,How they affect the house and claim of York.Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,I know no pain they can inflict upon himWill make him say I moved him to those arms.Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,Why, then from Ireland come I with my strengthAnd reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,And Henry put apart, the next for me.ExitSCENE II. Bury St. Edmund's. A room of state.Enter certain Murderers, hastily Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him knowWe have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.O that it were to do! What have we done?Didst ever hear a man so penitent?Enter SUFFOLKHere comes my lord.Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?Ay, my good lord, he's dead.Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;I will reward you for this venturous deed.The king and all the peers are here at hand.Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,According as I gave directions?'Tis, my good lord.Away! be gone.Exeunt MurderersSound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SOMERSET, with AttendantsGo, call our uncle to our presence straight;Say we intend to try his grace to-day.If he be guilty, as 'tis published.I'll call him presently, my noble lord.ExitLords, take your places; and, I pray you all,Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle GloucesterThan from true evidence of good esteemHe be approved in practise culpable.God forbid any malice should prevail,That faultless may condemn a nobleman!Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.Re-enter SUFFOLKHow now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.Marry, God forfend!God's secret judgment: I did dream to-nightThe duke was dumb and could not speak a word.KING HENRY VI swoonsHow fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!He doth revive again: madam, be patient.O heavenly God!How fares my gracious lord?Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?Came he right now to sing a raven's note,Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,By crying comfort from a hollow breast,Can chase away the first-conceived sound?Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyrannySits in grim majesty, to fright the world.Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;For in the shade of death I shall find joy;In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?Although the duke was enemy to him,Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:And for myself, foe as he was to me,Might liquid tears or heart-offending groansOr blood-consuming sighs recall his life,I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,And all to have the noble duke alive.What know I how the world may deem of me?For it is known we were but hollow friends:It may be judged I made the duke away;So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?I am no loathsome leper; look on me.What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.Erect his statue and worship it,And make my image but an alehouse sign.Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the seaAnd twice by awkward wind from England's bankDrove back again unto my native clime?What boded this, but well forewarning windDid seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?What did I then, but cursed the gentle gustsAnd he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rockYet AEolus would not be a murderer,But left that hateful office unto thee:The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sandsAnd would not dash me with their ragged sides,Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,Might in thy palace perish Margaret.As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,I stood upon the hatches in the storm,And when the dusky sky began to robMy earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,I took a costly jewel from my neck,A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:And even with this I lost fair England's viewAnd bid mine eyes be packing with my heartAnd call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,The agent of thy foul inconstancy,To sit and witch me, as Ascanius didWhen he to madding Dido would unfoldHis father's acts commenced in burning Troy!Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many CommonsIt is reported, mighty sovereign,That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'dBy Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.The commons, like an angry hive of beesThat want their leader, scatter up and downAnd care not who they sting in his revenge.Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,Until they hear the order of his death.That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;But how he died God knows, not Henry:Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,And comment then upon his sudden death.That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,With the rude multitude till I return.ExitO Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soulSome violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,For judgment only doth belong to thee.Fain would I go to chafe his paly lipsWith twenty thousand kisses, and to drainUpon his face an ocean of salt tears,To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:But all in vain are these mean obsequies;And to survey his dead and earthly image,What were it but to make my sorrow greater?Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bedCome hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.That is to see how deep my grave is made;For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,For seeing him I see my life in death.As surely as my soul intends to liveWith that dread King that took our state upon himTo free us from his father's wrathful curse,I do believe that violent hands were laidUpon the life of this thrice-famed duke.A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?See how the blood is settled in his face.Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,Being all descended to the labouring heart;Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returnethTo blush and beautify the cheek again.But see, his face is black and full of blood,His eye-balls further out than when he lived,Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'dAnd tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.It cannot be but he was murder'd here;The least of all these signs were probable.Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.Then you, belike, suspect these noblemenAs guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding freshAnd sees fast by a butcher with an axe,But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,But may imagine how the bird was dead,Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?Even so suspicious is this tragedy.Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,That shall be scoured in his rancorous heartThat slanders me with murder's crimson badge.Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and othersWhat dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?He dares not calm his contumelious spiritNor cease to be an arrogant controller,Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.Madam, be still; with reverence may I say;For every word you speak in his behalfIs slander to your royal dignity.Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,Thy mother took into her blameful bedSome stern untutor'd churl, and noble stockWas graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,And never of the Nevils' noble race.But that the guilt of murder bucklers theeAnd I should rob the deathsman of his fee,Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,I would, false murderous coward, on thy kneeMake thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,And say it was thy mother that thou meant'stThat thou thyself was born in bastardy;And after all this fearful homage done,Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,If from this presence thou darest go with me.Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with theeAnd do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICKWhat stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,And he but naked, though lock'd up in steelWhose conscience with injustice is corrupted.A noise withinWhat noise is this?Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK, with their weapons drawnWhy, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawnHere in our presence! dare you be so bold?Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?The traitorous Warwick with the men of BurySet all upon me, mighty sovereign.[To the Commons, entering] Sirs, stand apart;the king shall know your mind.Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,Or banished fair England's territories,They will by violence tear him from your palaceAnd torture him with grievous lingering death.They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;They say, in him they fear your highness' death;And mere instinct of love and loyalty,Free from a stubborn opposite intent,As being thought to contradict your liking,Makes them thus forward in his banishment.They say, in care of your most royal person,That if your highness should intend to sleepAnd charge that no man should disturb your restIn pain of your dislike or pain of death,Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,That slily glided towards your majesty,It were but necessary you were waked,Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,That they will guard you, whether you will or no,From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,With whose envenomed and fatal sting,Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,They say, is shamefully bereft of life.[Within] An answer from the king, myLord of Salisbury!'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,Could send such message to their sovereign:But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,To show how quaint an orator you are:But all the honour Salisbury hath wonIs, that he was the lord ambassadorSent from a sort of tinkers to the king.[Within] An answer from the king, or we will all break in!Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.I thank them for their tender loving care;And had I not been cited so by them,Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesyMischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:And therefore, by His majesty I swear,Whose far unworthy deputy I am,He shall not breathe infection in this airBut three days longer, on the pain of death.Exit SALISBURYO Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.Had I but said, I would have kept my word,But when I swear, it is irrevocable.If, after three days' space, thou here be'st foundOn any ground that I am ruler of,The world shall not be ransom for thy life.Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;I have great matters to impart to thee.Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLKMischance and sorrow go along with you!Heart's discontent and sour afflictionBe playfellows to keep you company!There's two of you; the devil make a third!And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,I would invent as bitter-searching terms,As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,With full as many signs of deadly hate,As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:And even now my burthen'd heart would break,Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,And boding screech-owls make the concert full!All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,And turn the force of them upon thyself.You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,Well could I curse away a winter's night,Though standing naked on a mountain top,Where biting cold would never let grass grow,And think it but a minute spent in sport.O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,That I may dew it with my mournful tears;Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,To wash away my woful monuments.O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,As one that surfeits thinking on a want.I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,Adventure to be banished myself:And banished I am, if but from thee.Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'dEmbrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,Loather a hundred times to part than die.Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;A wilderness is populous enough,So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:For where thou art, there is the world itself,With every several pleasure in the world,And where thou art not, desolation.I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.Enter VAUXWither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?To signify unto his majestyThat Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghostWere by his side; sometime he calls the king,And whispers to his pillow, as to him,The secrets of his overcharged soul;And I am sent to tell his majestyThat even now he cries aloud for him.Go tell this heavy message to the king.Exit VAUXAy me! what is this world! what news are these!But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,And with the southern clouds contend in tears,Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.If I depart from thee, I cannot live;And in thy sight to die, what were it elseBut like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?Here could I breathe my soul into the air,As mild and gentle as the cradle-babeDying with mother's dug between its lips:Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,Or I should breathe it so into thy body,And then it lived in sweet Elysium.To die by thee were but to die in jest;From thee to die were torture more than death:O, let me stay, befall what may befall!Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,It is applied to a deathful wound.To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.I go.And take my heart with thee.A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st caskThat ever did contain a thing of worth.Even as a splitted bark, so sunder weThis way fall I to death.This way for me.Exeunt severallySCENE III. A bedchamber.Enter the KING, SALISBURY, WARWICK, to the CARDINAL in bed How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, tothy sovereign.If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,Enough to purchase such another island,So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,Where death's approach is seen so terrible!Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.Bring me unto my trial when you will.Died he not in his bed? where should he die?Can I make men live, whether they will or no?O, torture me no more! I will confess.Alive again? then show me where he is:I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.Give me some drink; and bid the apothecaryBring the strong poison that I bought of him.O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!O, beat away the busy meddling fiendThat lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.And from his bosom purge this black despair!See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!So bad a death argues a monstrous life.Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;And let us all to meditation.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I. The coast of Kent.Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a Captain, a Master, a Master's-mate, WALTER WHITMORE, and others; with them SUFFOLK, and others, prisoners The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful dayIs crept into the bosom of the sea;And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jadesThat drag the tragic melancholy night;Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jawsBreathe foul contagious darkness in the air.Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.What is my ransom, master? let me know.A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.Master's-Mate And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,And bear the name and port of gentlemen?Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:The lives of those which we have lost in fightBe counterpoised with such a petty sum!I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.And so will I and write home for it straight.I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;To SUFFOLKAnd so should these, if I might have my will.Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.Look on my George; I am a gentleman:Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.How now! why start'st thou? what, dothdeath affright?Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.A cunning man did calculate my birthAnd told me that by water I should die:Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,But with our sword we wiped away the blot;Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,The honourable blood of Lancaster,Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth muleAnd thought thee happy when I shook my head?How often hast thou waited at my cup,Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;How in our voiding lobby hast thou stoodAnd duly waited for my coming forth?This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?First let my words stab him, as he hath me.Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.Convey him hence and on our longboat's sideStrike off his head.Thou darest not, for thy own.Yes, Pole.Pole!Pool! Sir Pool! lord!Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirtTroubles the silver spring where England drinks.Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouthFor swallowing the treasure of the realm:Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,For daring to affy a mighty lordUnto the daughter of a worthless king,Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.By devilish policy art thou grown great,And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorgedWith gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,The false revolting Normans thorough theeDisdain to call us lord, and PicardyHath slain their governors, surprised our forts,And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,As hating thee, are rising up in arms:And now the house of York, thrust from the crownBy shameful murder of a guiltless kingAnd lofty proud encroaching tyranny,Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful coloursAdvance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'The commons here in Kent are up in arms:And, to conclude, reproach and beggaryIs crept into the palace of our king.And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunderUpon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!Small things make base men proud: this villain here,Being captain of a pinnace, threatens moreThan Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:It is impossible that I should dieBy such a lowly vassal as thyself.Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:I go of message from the queen to France;I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.Walter,--Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.Far be it we should honour such as theseWith humble suit: no, rather let my headStoop to the block than these knees bow to anySave to the God of heaven and to my king;And sooner dance upon a bloody poleThan stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.True nobility is exempt from fear:More can I bear than you dare execute.Hale him away, and let him talk no more.Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,That this my death may never be forgot!Great men oft die by vile bezonians:A Roman sworder and banditto slaveMurder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard handStabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islandersPompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.Exeunt Whitmore and others with SuffolkAnd as for these whose ransom we have set,It is our pleasure one of them depart;Therefore come you with us and let him go.Exeunt all but the First GentlemanRe-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's bodyThere let his head and lifeless body lie,Until the queen his mistress bury it.ExitO barbarous and bloody spectacle!His body will I bear unto the king:If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;So will the queen, that living held him dear.Exit with the bodySCENE II. Blackheath.Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;they have been up these two days.They have the more need to sleep now, then.I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dressthe commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say itwas never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;which is as much to say as, let the magistrates belabouring men; and therefore should we bemagistrates.Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of abrave mind than a hard hand.I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, thetanner of Wingham,--He shall have the skin of our enemies, to makedog's-leather of.And Dick the Butcher,--Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity'sthroat cut like a calf.And Smith the weaver,--Argo, their thread of life is spun.Come, come, let's fall in with them.Drum. Enter CADE, DICK the Butcher, SMITH the Weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbersWe John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--[Aside] Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired withthe spirit of putting down kings and princes,--Command silence.Silence!My father was a Mortimer,--[Aside] He was an honest man, and a goodbricklayer.My mother a Plantagenet,--[Aside] I knew her well; she was a midwife.My wife descended of the Lacies,--[Aside] She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, andsold many laces.[Aside] But now of late, notable to travel with herfurred pack, she washes bucks here at home.Therefore am I of an honourable house.[Aside] Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;and there was he borne, under a hedge, for hisfather had never a house but the cage.Valiant I am.[Aside] A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.I am able to endure much.[Aside] No question of that; for I have seen himwhipped three market-days together.I fear neither sword nor fire.[Aside] He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.[Aside] But methinks he should stand in fear offire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vowsreformation. There shall be in England sevenhalfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hoopedpot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felonyto drink small beer: all the realm shall be incommon; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go tograss: and when I am king, as king I will be,--God save your majesty!I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;all shall eat and drink on my score; and I willapparel them all in one livery, that they may agreelike brothers and worship me their lord.The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentablething, that of the skin of an innocent lamb shouldbe made parchment? that parchment, being scribbledo'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but sealonce to a thing, and I was never mine own mansince. How now! who's there?Enter some, bringing forward the Clerk of ChathamThe clerk of Chatham: he can write and read andcast accompt.O monstrous!We took him setting of boys' copies.Here's a villain!Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.Nay, then, he is a conjurer.Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of minehonour; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee: what is thy name?Emmanuel.They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twillgo hard with you.Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? orhast thou a mark to thyself, like an honestplain-dealing man?Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought upthat I can write my name.He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villainand a traitor.Away with him, I say! hang him with his pen andink-horn about his neck.Exit one with the ClerkEnter MICHAELWhere's our general?Here I am, thou particular fellow.Fly, fly, fly!

Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Sayhath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:and more than that, he can speak French; andtherefore he is a traitor.O gross and miserable ignorance!Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are ourenemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he thatspeaks with the tongue of an enemy be a goodcounsellor, or no?No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,Assail them with the army of the king.Herald, away; and throughout every townProclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;That those which fly before the battle endsMay, even in their wives' and children's sight,Be hang'd up for example at their doors:And you that be the king's friends, follow me.Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY, and soldiersAnd you that love the commons, follow me.Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;For they are thrifty honest men, and suchAs would, but that they dare not, take our parts.They are all in order and march toward us.But then are we in order when we are mostout of order.

The palace.Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication, and the QUEEN with SUFFOLK'S head, BUCKINGHAM and Lord SAY Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,And makes it fearful and degenerate;Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.But who can cease to weep and look on this?Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:But where's the body that I should embrace?What answer makes your grace to the rebels'supplication?I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;For God forbid so many simple soulsShould perish by the sword! And I myself,Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,Will parley with Jack Cade their general:But stay, I'll read it over once again.Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely faceRuled, like a wandering planet, over me,And could it not enforce them to relent,That were unworthy to behold the same?Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.How now, madam!Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.Enter a MessengerHow now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,And calls your grace usurper openlyAnd vows to crown himself in Westminster.His army is a ragged multitudeOf hinds and peasants, rude and merciless:Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's deathHath given them heart and courage to proceed:All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.O graceless men! they know not what they do.My gracious lord, return to Killingworth,Until a power be raised to put them down.Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!Lord Say, the traitors hate thee;Therefore away with us to Killingworth.So might your grace's person be in danger.The sight of me is odious in their eyes;And therefore in this city will I stayAnd live alone as secret as I may.Enter another MessengerJack Cade hath gotten London bridge:The citizens fly and forsake their houses:The rascal people, thirsting after prey,Join with the traitor, and they jointly swearTo spoil the city and your royal court.Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us.My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.The trust I have is in mine innocence,And therefore am I bold and resolute.ExeuntSCENE V. London. The Tower.Enter SCALES upon the Tower, walking. Then enter two or three Citizens below How now! is Jack Cade slain?No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they havewon the bridge, killing all those that withstandthem: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour fromthe Tower, to defend the city from the rebels.Such aid as I can spare you shall command;But I am troubled here with them myself;The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.But get you to Smithfield, and gather head,And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe;Fight for your king, your country and your lives;And so, farewell, for I must hence again.ExeuntSCENE VI.

And nowhenceforward it shall be treason for any that callsme other than Lord Mortimer.Enter a Soldier, runningJack Cade!

Ah,thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! nowart thou within point-blank of our jurisdictionregal. What canst thou answer to my majesty forgiving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, thedauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by thesepresence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that Iam the besom that must sweep the court clean of suchfilth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorouslycorrupted the youth of the realm in erecting agrammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathershad no other books but the score and the tally, thouhast caused printing to be used, and, contrary tothe king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built apaper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thouhast men about thee that usually talk of a noun anda verb, and such abominable words as no Christianear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointedjustices of peace, to call poor men before themabout matters they were not able to answer.Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and becausethey could not read, thou hast hanged them; when,indeed, only for that cause they have been mostworthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?What of that?Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear acloak, when honester men than thou go in their hoseand doublets.And work in their shirt too; as myself, for example,that am a butcher.You men of Kent,--What say you of Kent?Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.'Away with him, away with him! he speaks Latin.Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,Is term'd the civil'st place of this isle:Sweet is the country, because full of riches;The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.Justice with favour have I always done;Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.When have I aught exacted at your hands,But to maintain the king, the realm and you?Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,Because my book preferr'd me to the king,And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,You cannot but forbear to murder me:This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kingsFor your behoof,--Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struckThose that I never saw and struck them dead.O monstrous coward! what, to come behind folks?These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.Long sitting to determine poor men's causesHath made me full of sickness and diseases.Ye shall have a hempen caudle, then, and the help of hatchet.Why dost thou quiver, man?The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.Nay, he nods at us, as who should say, I'll be evenwith you: I'll see if his head will stand steadieron a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead him.Tell me wherein have I offended most?Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.O, let me live![Aside] I feel remorse in myself with his words;but I'll bridle it: he shall die, an it be but forpleading so well for his life. Away with him! hehas a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not o'God's name. Go, take him away, I say, and strikeoff his head presently; and then break into hisson-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer, and strike offhis head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.It shall be done.Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,God should be so obdurate as yourselves,How would it fare with your departed souls?And therefore yet relent, and save my life.Away with him! and do as I command ye.Exeunt some with Lord SAYThe proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a headon his shoulders, unless he pay me tribute; thereshall not a maid be married, but she shall pay to meher maidenhead ere they have it: men shall hold ofme in capite; and we charge and command that theirwives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell.My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside and take upcommodities upon our bills?Marry, presently.O, brave!Re-enter one with the headsBut is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,for they loved well when they were alive. Now partthem again, lest they consult about the giving up ofsome more towns in France. Soldiers, defer thespoil of the city until night: for with these bornebefore us, instead of maces, will we ride throughthe streets, and at every corner have them kiss. Away!ExeuntSCENE VIII. Southwark.Alarum and retreat. Enter CADE and all his rabblement Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Killand knock down! throw them into Thames!Sound a parleyWhat noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold tosound retreat or parley, when I command them kill?Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD, attendedAy, here they be that dare and will disturb thee:Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the kingUnto the commons whom thou hast misled;And here pronounce free pardon to them allThat will forsake thee and go home in peace.What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent,And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you;Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!'Who hateth him and honours not his father,Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.God save the king! God save the king!What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave? Andyou, base peasants, do ye believe him? will youneeds be hanged with your pardons about your necks?Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,that you should leave me at the White Hart inSouthwark? I thought ye would never have given outthese arms till you had recovered your ancientfreedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,and delight to live in slavery to the nobility. Letthem break your backs with burthens, take yourhouses over your heads, ravish your wives anddaughters before your faces: for me, I will makeshift for one; and so, God's curse light upon youall!We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?Will he conduct you through the heart of France,And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to;Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,Unless by robbing of your friends and us.Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?Methinks already in this civil broilI see them lording it in London streets,Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarryThan you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.To France, to France, and get what you have lost;Spare England, for it is your native coast;Henry hath money, you are strong and manly;God on our side, doubt not of victory.A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as thismultitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales themto an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave medesolate. I see them lay their heads together tosurprise me. My sword make way for me, for here isno staying. In despite of the devils and hell, havethrough the very middest of you? and heavens andhonour be witness, that no want of resolution in me.but only my followers' base and ignominioustreasons, makes me betake me to my heels.ExitWhat, is he fled? Go some, and follow him;And he that brings his head unto the kingShall have a thousand crowns for his reward.Exeunt some of themFollow me, soldiers: we'll devise a meanTo reconcile you all unto the king.ExeuntSCENE IX.

God save the king!Enter a MessengerPlease it your grace to be advertisedThe Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,And with a puissant and a mighty powerOf gallowglasses and stout kernsIs marching hitherward in proud array,And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,His arms are only to remove from theeThe Duke of Somerset, whom he terms traitor.Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest,Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate:But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed;And now is York in arms to second him.I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,And ask him what's the reason of these arms.Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,Until his army be dismiss'd from him.My lord,I'll yield myself to prison willingly,Or unto death, to do my country good.In any case, be not too rough in terms;For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.I will, my lord; and doubt not so to dealAs all things shall redound unto your good.Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;For yet may England curse my wretched reign.Flourish.

These five days have Ihid me in these woods and durst not peep out, forall the country is laid for me; but now am I sohungry that if I might have a lease of my life for athousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, tosee if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet anotherwhile, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomachthis hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'was born to do me good: for many a time, but for asallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brownbill; and many a time, when I have been dry andbravely marching, it hath served me instead of aquart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'must serve me to feed on.Enter IDENLord, who would live turmoiled in the court,And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?This small inheritance my father left meContenteth me, and worth a monarchy.I seek not to wax great by others' waning,Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:Sufficeth that I have maintains my stateAnd sends the poor well pleased from my gate.Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for astray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousandcrowns of the king carrying my head to him: butI'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallowmy sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?Is't not enough to break into my garden,And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever wasbroached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: Ihave eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou andthy five men, and if I do not leave you all as deadas a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;And if mine arm be heaved in the air,Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.As for words, whose greatness answers words,Let this my sword report what speech forbears.By my valour, the most complete champion that ever Iheard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not outthe burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thousleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thoumayst be turned to hobnails.Here they fight. CADE fallsO, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:let ten thousand devils come against me, and give mebut the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy themall. Wither, garden; and be henceforth aburying-place to all that do dwell in this house,because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point;But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,To emblaze the honour that thy master got.Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. TellKent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhortall the world to be cowards; for I, that neverfeared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.DiesHow much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heelsUnto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,And there cut off thy most ungracious head;Which I will bear in triumph to the king,Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.ExitACT VSCENE I. Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum and colours From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,To entertain great England's lawful king.Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?Let them obey that know not how to rule;This hand was made to handle naught but gold.I cannot give due action to my words,Except a sword or sceptre balance it:A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.Enter BUCKINGHAMWhom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,To know the reason of these arms in peace;Or why thou, being a subject as I am,Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,Should raise so great a power without his leave,Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.[Aside] Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,I am so angry at these abject terms;And now, like Ajax Telamonius,On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.I am far better born than is the king,More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:But I must make fair weather yet a while,Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,That I have given no answer all this while;My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.The cause why I have brought this army hitherIs to remove proud Somerset from the king,Seditious to his grace and to the state.That is too much presumption on thy part:But if thy arms be to no other end,The king hath yielded unto thy demand:The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,You shall have pay and every thing you wish.And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,As pledges of my fealty and love;I'll send them all as willing as I live:Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,Is his to use, so Somerset may die.York, I commend this kind submission:We twain will go into his highness' tent.Enter KING HENRY VI and AttendantsBuckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?In all submission and humilityYork doth present himself unto your highness.Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,Who since I heard to be discomfited.Enter IDEN, with CADE'S headIf one so rude and of so mean conditionMay pass into the presence of a king,Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!O, let me view his visage, being dead,That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?I was, an't like your majesty.How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?Alexander Iden, that's my name;A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amissHe were created knight for his good service.Iden, kneel down.He kneelsRise up a knight.We give thee for reward a thousand marks,And will that thou henceforth attend on us.May Iden live to merit such a bounty.And never live but true unto his liege!RisesEnter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSETSee, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,But boldly stand and front him to his face.How now! is Somerset at liberty?Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.That head of thine doth not become a crown;Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,Is able with the change to kill and cure.Here is a hand to hold a sceptre upAnd with the same to act controlling laws.Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no moreO'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,If they can brook I bow a knee to man.Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;Exit AttendantI know, ere they will have me go to ward,They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,To say if that the bastard boys of YorkShall be the surety for their traitor father.Exit BUCKINGHAMO blood-besotted Neapolitan,Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,Shall be their father's bail; and bane to thoseThat for my surety will refuse the boys!Enter EDWARD and RICHARDSee where they come: I'll warrant they'llmake it good.Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORDAnd here comes Clifford to deny their bail.Health and all happiness to my lord the king!KneelsI thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.This is my king, York, I do not mistake;But thou mistakest me much to think I do:To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humourMakes him oppose himself against his king.He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,And chop away that factious pate of his.He is arrested, but will not obey;His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.Will you not, sons?Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.And if words will not, then our weapons shall.Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!Look in a glass, and call thy image so:I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,That with the very shaking of their chainsThey may astonish these fell-lurking curs:Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURYAre these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening curRun back and bite, because he was withheld;Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:And such a piece of service will you do,If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?If it be banish'd from the frosty head,Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,And shame thine honourable age with blood?Why art thou old, and want'st experience?Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?For shame! in duty bend thy knee to meThat bows unto the grave with mickle age.My lord, I have consider'd with myselfThe title of this most renowned duke;And in my conscience do repute his graceThe rightful heir to England's royal seat.Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?I have.Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?It is great sin to swear unto a sin,But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.Who can be bound by any solemn vowTo do a murderous deed, to rob a man,To force a spotless virgin's chastity,To reave the orphan of his patrimony,To wring the widow from her custom'd right,And have no other reason for this wrongBut that he was bound by a solemn oath?A subtle traitor needs no sophister.Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,I am resolved for death or dignity.The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.You were best to go to bed and dream again,To keep thee from the tempest of the field.I am resolved to bear a greater stormThan any thou canst conjure up to-day;And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,Might I but know thee by thy household badge.Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,As on a mountain top the cedar showsThat keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,Even to affright thee with the view thereof.And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bearAnd tread it under foot with all contempt,Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.And so to arms, victorious father,To quell the rebels and their complices.Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.Exeunt severallySCENE II. Saint Alban's.Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarumAnd dead men's cries do fill the empty air,Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.Enter YORKHow now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,But match to match I have encounter'd himAnd made a prey for carrion kites and crowsEven of the bonny beast he loved so well.Enter CLIFFORDOf one or both of us the time is come.Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,For I myself must hunt this deer to death.Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.ExitWhat seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?With thy brave bearing should I be in love,But that thou art so fast mine enemy.Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.So let it help me now against thy swordAs I in justice and true right express it.My soul and body on the action both!A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.They fight, and CLIFFORD fallsLa fin couronne les oeuvres.DiesThus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!ExitEnter YOUNG CLIFFORDShame and confusion! all is on the rout;Fear frames disorder, and disorder woundsWhere it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,Whom angry heavens do make their ministerThrow in the frozen bosoms of our partHot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.He that is truly dedicate to warHath no self-love, nor he that loves himselfHath not essentially but by circumstanceThe name of valour.Seeing his dead fatherO, let the vile world end,And the premised flames of the last dayKnit earth and heaven together!Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,Particularities and petty soundsTo cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieveThe silver livery of advised age,And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thusTo die in ruffian battle? Even at this sightMy heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;No more will I their babes: tears virginalShall be to me even as the dew to fire,And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaimsShall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:Meet I an infant of the house of York,Into as many gobbets will I cut itAs wild Medea young Absyrtus did:In cruelty will I seek out my fame.Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:As did AEneas old Anchises bear,So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;But then AEneas bare a living load,Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.Exit, bearing off his fatherEnter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is killedSo, lie thou there;For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,The Castle in Saint Alban's, SomersetHath made the wizard famous in his death.Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.ExitFight: excursions. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and othersAway, my lord! you are slow; for shame, away!Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay.What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,To give the enemy way, and to secure usBy what we can, which can no more but fly.Alarum afar offIf you be ta'en, we then should see the bottomOf all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,As well we may, if not through your neglect,We shall to London get, where you are lovedAnd where this breach now in our fortunes madeMay readily be stopp'd.Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORDBut that my heart's on future mischief set,I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:But fly you must; uncurable discomfitReigns in the hearts of all our present parts.Away, for your relief! and we will liveTo see their day and them our fortune give:Away, my lord, away!ExeuntSCENE III. Fields near St. Alban's.Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and Soldiers, with drum and colours Of Salisbury, who can report of him,That winter lion, who in rage forgetsAged contusions and all brush of time,And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,Repairs him with occasion? This happy dayIs not itself, nor have we won one foot,If Salisbury be lost.My noble father,Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,Persuaded him from any further act:But still, where danger was, still there I met him;And like rich hangings in a homely house,So was his will in his old feeble body.But, noble as he is, look where he comes.Enter SALISBURYNow, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:God knows how long it is I have to live;And it hath pleased him that three times to-dayYou have defended me from imminent death.Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,Being opposites of such repairing nature.I know our safety is to follow them;For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,To call a present court of parliament.Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?After them! nay, before them, if we can.Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:Saint Alban's battle won by famous YorkShall be eternized in all age to come.Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all:And more such days as these to us befall!Exeunt
