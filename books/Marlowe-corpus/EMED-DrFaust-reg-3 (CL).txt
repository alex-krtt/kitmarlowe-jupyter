THETRAGICALHistory of Doctor Faustus.As it hath been Acted by the RightHonorable the Earl of Nottingham his servants.Written by Christopher MarloweLONDONPrinted by V. S. for Thomas Bushell. 1604.The tragical Historyof Doctor Faustus.Enter Chorus.NOt marching now in fields of Thrasimene,Where Mars did mate the Carthaginians,Nor sporting in the dalliance of love,In courts of Kings where state is overturned,Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds,Intends our Muse to daunt his heavenly verse:Only this (Gentlemen) we must perform,The form of Faustus fortunes good or bad.To patient Judgements we appeal our plaud,And speak for Faustus in his infancy:Now is he born, his parents base of stock,In Germany, within a town called Rhodes:Of riper years to Wertenberg he went,Whereas his kinsmen chiefly brought him up,So soon he profits in Divinity,The fruitful plot of Scholarism graced,That shortly he was graced with Doctors name,Excelling all, whose sweet delight disputesIn heavenly matters of Theology,Till swolln with cunning of a self conceit,His waxen wings did mount above his reach,And melting heavens conspired his overthrow.For falling to a devilish exercise,And glutted more with learnings golden gifts,He surfeits upon cursed Necromancy,Nothing so sweet as magic is to himWhich he prefers before his chiefest bliss,And this the man that in his study sits.Exit.Enter Faustus in his Study.Settle thy studies Faustus, and beginTo sound the depth of that thou wilt profess:Having commenced, be a Divine in show,Yet level at the end of every Art,And live and die in Aristotles works:Sweet Analytics tis thou hast ravished me,Bene disserere est finis logices,Is, to dispute well, Logics chiefest endAffords this Art no greater miracle:Then read no more, thou hast attained the end:A greater subject fitteth Faustus wit,Bid On kai me on farewell, Galen come:Seeing, ubi desinit philosophus, ibi incipit medicus.Be a physician Faustus, heap up gold,And be eternized for some wondrous cure,Summum bonum medicinae sanitas,The end of physic is our bodys health:Why Faustus, hast thou not attained that end?Is not thy common talk sound Aphorisms?Are not thy bills hung up as monuments,whereby whole Cities have escaped the plague,And thousand desprate maladies been eased,Yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man.wouldst thou make man to live eternally?Or being dead, raise them to life again?Then this profession were to be esteemed.Physic farewell, where is Justinian?Si una eademque res legatus duobus,Alter rem alter valorem rei, etc.A pretty case of paltry legacies:Exhaereditare filium non potest pater nisi:Such is the subject of the instituteAnd universal body of the Church:His study fits a mercenary drudge,who aims at nothing but external trash,The devil and illiberal for me:when all is done, Divinity is best.Jeromes Bible, Faustus, view it well.Stipendium peccati mors est: ha, Stipendium, etc.The reward of sin is death: thats hard.Si peccasse negamus, fallimur, et nulla est in nobis veritas.If we say that we have no sin,We deceive ourselves, and theres no truth in us.Why then belike we must sin,And so consequently die.Ay, we must die an everlasting death:What doctrine call you this, Che sera, sera,What will be, shall be? Divinity, adieu,These Metaphysics of Magicians,And Necromantic books are heavenlyLines, circles, scenes, letters and characters:Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires.O what a world of profit and delight,Of power, of honor, of omnipotenceIs promised to the studious Artisan?All things that move between the quiet polesShall be at my command. Emperors and Kings,Are but obeyed in their several provinces:Nor can they raise the wind, or rend the clouds:But his dominion that exceeds in this,Stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man.A sound Magician is a mighty god:Here Faustus try thy brains to gain a deity.Enter Wagner.commend me to my dearest friends,The German Valdes, and Cornelius,Request them earnestly to visit me.I will sir.exit.Their conference will be a greater help to me,Than all my labors, plod I neer so fast.Enter the good Angel and the evil Angel.O Faustus, lay that damned book aside,And gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,And heap Gods heavy wrath upon thy head,Read, read the scriptures, that is blasphemy.Go forward Faustus in that famous art,Wherein all natures treasury is contained:Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky,Lord and commander of these Elements.Exeunt.How am I glutted with conceit of this?Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please,Resolve me of all ambiguities,Perform what desperate enterprise I will?Ill have them fly to India for gold,Ransack the Ocean for orient pearl,And search all corners of the new-found worldFor pleasant fruits and princely delicates:Ill have them read me strange philosophy,And tell the secrets of all foreign kings,Ill have them wall all Germany with brass,And make swift Rhine circle fair Wertenberg,Ill have them fill the public schools with skill.Wherewith the students shall be bravely clad:Ill levy soldiers with the coin they bring,And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,And reign sole king of all our provinces:Yea stranger engines for the brunt of war,Than was the fiery keel at Antwerps bridge,Ill make my servile spirits to invent:Come German Valdes and Cornelius,And make me blessed with your sage conference,sweet Valdes, and Cornelius,Enter Valdes and Cornelius.Know that your words have won me at the last,To practice Magic and concealed arts:Yet not your words only, but mine own fantasy,That will receive no object for my head,But ruminates on Necromantic skill,Philosophy is odious and obscure,Both Law and Physic are for petty wits,Divinity is basest of the three,Unpleasant, harsh, contemptible and vild,Tis Magic, Magic that hath ravished me,Then gentle friends aid me in this attempt,And I that have with Concise syllogismsGravelled the Pastors of the German Church,And made the flowring pride of WertenbergSwarm to my Problems as the infernal spiritsOn sweet Musaeus when he came to hell,Will be as cunning as Agrippa was,Whose shadows made all Europe honor him.these books thy wit and our experienceShall make all nations to us,As Indian Moors obey their Spanish Lords,So shall the subjects of every elementBe always serviceable to us three,Like Lions shall they guard us when we please,Like Almain Rutters with their horsemens staves,Or Lapland Giants trotting by our sides,Sometimes like women, or unwedded maids,Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows,Than in their white breasts of the queen of Love:For Venice shall they drag huge Argosies,And from America the golden fleece,That yearly stuffs old Philips treasuryIf learned Faustus will be resolute.as resolute am I in thisAs thou to live, therefore object it not.The miracles that Magic will perform,Will make thee vow to study nothing else,He that is grounded in Astrology,Enriched with tongues well seen minerals,Hath all the principles Magic doth require,Then doubt not (Faustus) but to be renowned,And more frequented for this mystery,Than heretofore the Delphian Oracle.The spirits tell me they can dry the sea,And fetch the treasure of all foreign wracks,Ay, all the wealth that our forefathers hidWithin the massy entrails of the earth.Then tell me Faustus, what shall we three want?Nothing Cornelius, O this cheers my soul,Come show me some demonstrations magical,That I may conjure in some lusty grove,And have these joys in full possession.Then haste thee to some solitary grove,And bear wise Bacons and Albanus works,The Hebrew Psalter, and new Testament,And whatsoever else is requisitewe will inform thee ere our conference cease.Valdes, first let him know the words of art,And then all other ceremonies learned,may try his cunning by himself.First Ill instruct thee in the rudiments,And then wilt thou be perfecter than I.Then come and dine with me, and after meatWell canvas every quiddity thereof:For ere I sleep Ill try what I can do,This night Ill conjure though I die therefore.Exeunt.Enter two Scholars.I wonder whats become of Faustus, that waswont to make our schools ring with, sic probo.That shall we know, for see here comes his boy.Enter Wagner.How now sirrah, wheres thy master?God in heaven knows.Why, dost not thou know?Yes I know, but that follows not.Go to sirrah, leave your jesting, and tell us wherehe is.That follows not necessary by force of argument,that you being licentiate should stand upon t, therefore acknowledgeyour error, and be attentive.Why, didst thou not say thou knewest?Have you any witness on t?Yes sirrah, I heard you.Ask my fellow if I be a thief.Well, you will not tell us.Yes sir, I will tell you, yet if you were not duncesyou would never ask me such a question, for is not he corpusnaturale, and is not that mobile, then wherefore shouldyou ask me such a question: but that I am by nature phlegmatic,slow to wrath, and prone to lechery, (to love Iwould say) it were not for you to come within forty foot ofthe place of execution, although I do not doubt to see youboth hanged the next Sessions. Thus having triumphed overyou, I will set my countenance like a precisian, and begin tospeak thus: truly my dear brethren, my master is withinat dinner with Valdes and Cornelius, as this wine if it couldspeak, it would inform your worships, and so the Lordbless you, preserve you, and keep you my dear brethren,my dear brethren.exit.Nay then I fear he is falln into that damned art, forwhich they two are infamous through the world.Were he a stranger, and not allied to me, yet shouldI grieve for him: but come let us go and inform the Rector,and see if he by his grave counsel can reclaim him.O but I fear me nothing can reclaim him.Yet let us try what we can do.Exeunt.Enter Faustus to conjure.Now that the gloomy shadow of the earth,Longing to view Orions drizzling look,Leaps from th antarctic world unto the sky,And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath:begin thine incantations,And try if devils will obey thy hest,Seeing thou hast prayed and sacrificed to them.Within this circle is Jehovahs name,Forward and backward, and Agramithist,The breviated names of holy Saints,Figures of every adjunct to the heavens,And characters of signs and erring stars.By which the spirits are enforced to rise,Then fear not Faustus, but be resolute,And try the uttermost Magic can perform.Sint mihi dei acherontis propitii, valeat numen triplex Jehovae, ignei,aerii, Aquatani spiritus salvete, Orientis princeps Beelzebub, inferniardentis monarcha et demigorgon, propitiamus vos, ut apariat etsurgat Mephistopheles, quod tumeraris, per Jehovam gehennam etconsecratam aquam quam nunc spargo, signumque crucis quodnuncfacio, et per vota nostra ipse nunc surgat nobis dicatis Mephistopheles.Enter a Devil.I charge thee to return and change thy shape,Thou art too ugly to attend on me,Go and return an old Franciscan Friar,That holy shape becomes a devil best.Exit devil.I see theres virtue in my heavenly words,Who would not be proficient in this art?How pliant is this Mephistopheles?Full of obedience and humility,Such is the force of Magic and my spells,No Faustus, thou art Conjurer laureateThat canst command great Mephistopheles,Quin regis Mephistopheles fratris imagine.Enter Mephistopheles.Now Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,To do whatever Faustus shall command,Be it to make the Moon drop from her sphere,Or the Ocean to overwhelm the world.I am a servant to great Lucifer,And may not follow thee without his leave,No more than he commands must we perform.Did not he charge thee to appear to me?No, I came now hither of mine own accord.Did not my coniuring speeches raise thee? speak.That was the cause, but yet per accident,For when we hear one rack the name of God,Abjure the scriptures, and his Savior Christ,We fly, in hope to get his glorious soul,Nor will we come, unless he use such meansWhereby he is in danger to be damned:Therefore the shortest cut for conjuringIs stoutly to abjure the Trinity,And pray devoutly to the prince of hell.So Faustus hath already done, and holds this principleThere is no chief but only Beelzebub,To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself,This word damnation terrifies not him,For he confounds hell in Elysium,His ghost be with the old Philosophers,But leaving these vain trifles of mens souls,Tell me what is that Lucifer thy Lord?Arch-regent and commander of all spirits.Was not that Lucifer an Angel once?Yes Faustus, and most dear loved of God.How comes it then that he is prince of devils?O by aspiring pride and insolence,For which God threw him from the face of heaven.and what are you that live with Lucifer?Unhappy spirits that fell with Lucifer,Conspired against our God with Lucifer,And are for ever damned with Lucifer.Where are you damned?In hell.How comes it then that thou art out of hell?Why this is hell, nor am I out of it:Think'st thou that I who saw the face of God,And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,In being deprived of everlasting bliss:O Faustus, leave these frivolous demands,which strike a terror to my fainting soul.What, is great Mephistopheles so passionate,For being deprived of the joys of heaven?Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude,And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess.Go bear those tidings to great Lucifer,Seeing Faustus hath incurred eternal death,By desprate thoughts against Joves deity:Say, he surrenders up to him his soul,So he will spare him 24. years,Letting him live in all voluptuousness,Having thee ever to attend on me,To give me whatsoever I shall ask,To tell me whatsoever I demand,To slay mine enemies, and aid my friends,And always be obedient to my will:Go and return to mighty Lucifer,And meet me in my study at midnight,And then resolve me of thy masters mind.I will Faustus.exit.Had I as many souls as there be stars,Id give them all for Mephistopheles:By him Ill be great Emperor of the world,And make a bridge through the moving air,To pass the Ocean with a band of men,Ill join the hills that bind the Afric shore,And make that land continent to Spain,And both contributory to my crown:The Emperor shall not live but by my leave,Nor any Potentate of Germany:Now that I have obtained what I desire,Ill live in speculation of this Art,Till Mephistopheles return again.exit.Enter Wagner and the Clown.Sirrah boy, come hither.How, boy? swounds boy, I hope you have seen manyboys with such pickadevaunts as I have. Boy quotha?Tell me sirrah, hast thou any comings in?Ay, and goings out too, you may see else.Alas poor slave, see how poverty jesteth in his nakedness,the villain is bare, and out of service, and so hungry,that I know he would give his soul to the Devil for ashoulder of mutton, though it were blood raw.How, my soul to the Devil for a shoulder of muttonthough twere blood raw? not so good friend, by r lady Ihad need have it well roasted, and good sauce to it, if I pay sodear.well, wilt thou serve me, and Ill make thee go likeQui mihi discipulus?How, in verse?No sirrah, in beaten silk and stavesacre .how, how, knaves acre?

O something soundeth in mine ears:Abjure this Magic, turn to God again,Ay and Faustus will turn to God again.To God? he loves thee not,The god thou servest is thine own appetite,wherein is fixed the love of Beelzebub,To him Ill build an altar and a church,And offer lukewarm blood of new born babes.Enter good Angel, and Evil.Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art.Contrition, prayer, repentance: what of them?O they are means to bring thee untoheaven.Rather illusions fruits of lunacy,That makes men foolish that do trust them most.Sweet Faustus think of heaven, and heavenlythings.No Faustus, think of honor and wealth.Of wealth,exeunt.Why the signory of Emden shall be mine,when Mephistopheles shall stand by me,What God can hurt thee Faustus?

thinkst thou then that Faustus shall bedamned?Ay of necessity, for heres the scroll,Wherein thou hast given thy soul to Lucifer.Ay, and body too, but what of that?Thinkst thou that Faustus is so fond,To imagine, that after this life there is any pain?Tush these are trifles and mere old wives tales.But Faustus I am an instance to prove the contraryFor I am damned, and am now in hell.How? now in hell? nay and this be hell, Ill willinglybe damned here: what walking, disputing, etc. Butleaving off this, let me have a wife, the fairest maid in Germany,for I am wanton and lascivious, and can not livewithout a wife.How, a wife? I prithee Faustus talk not of a wife.Nay sweet Mephistopheles fetch me one, for I willhave one.Well thou wilt have one, sit there till I come, Illfetch thee a wife in the devils name.Enter with a devil dressed like a woman,with fireworks.Tell Faustus, how dost thou like thy wife?A plague on her for a hot whore.Tut Faustus, marriage is but a ceremonial toy, ifthou lovest me, think more of it.Ill cull thee out the fairest courtesans,And bring them every morning to thy bed,She whom thine eye shall like, thy heart shall have,Be she as chaste as was Penelope,As wise as Saba, or as beautifulAs was bright Lucifer before his fall.Hold, take this book, peruse it thoroughly,The iterating of these lines brings gold,The framing of this circle on the ground,Brings whirlwinds, tempests, thunder and lightning.Pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself,And men in armor shall appear to thee,Ready to execute what thou desirst.Thanks Mephistopheles, yet fain would I havea book wherein I might behold all spells and incantations,that I might raise up spirits when I please.Here they are in this book.There turn to themNow would I have a book where I might see allcharacters and planets of the heavens, that I might knowtheir motions and dispositions.Here they are too.Turn to themNay let me have one book more, and then I havedone, wherein I might see all plants, herbs and trees thatgrow upon the earth.Here they be.O thou art deceived.Tut I warrant thee.Turn to themWhen I behold the heavens, than I repent,And curse thee wicked Mephistopheles,Because thou hast deprived me of those joys.why Faustus,Thinkst thou heaven is such a glorious thing?I tell thee tis not half so fair as thou,Or any man that breathes on earth.How provest thou that?It was made for man, therefore is man moreexcellent.If it were made for man, twas made for me:I will renounce this magic, and repent.Enter good Angel, and evil Angel.Faustus, repent yet, God will pity thee.Thou art a spirit, God cannot pity thee.who buzzeth in mine ears I am a spirit?Be I a devil, yet God may pity me,Ay God will pity me, if I repent.Ay but Faustus never shall repent.exeuntMy hearts so hardened I cannot repent,Scarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven,But fearful echoes thunders in mine ears,thou art damned, then swords and knives,Poison, guns, halters, and envenomed steelAre laid before me to dispatch myself,And long ere this I should have slain myself,Had not sweet pleasure conquered deep despair.Have not I made blind Homer sing to me,Of Alexanders love, and Oenones death,And hath not he that built the walls of Thebes,With ravishing sound of his melodious harpMade music with my Mephistopheles,Why should I die then, or basely despair?I am resolved Faustus shall neer repent,Come Mephistopheles, let us dispute again,And argue of divine Astrology,Tell me, are there many heavens above the Moon?Are all celestial bodies but one globe,As is the substance of this centric earth?As are the elements, such are the spheres,Mutually folded in each others orb,And Faustus all jointly move upon one axletree,Whose terminine is termed the worlds wide pole,Nor are the names of Saturn, Mars, or JupiterFeigned, but are erring stars.But tell me, have they all one motion? both situ ettempore.All jointly move from East to West in 24. hoursupon the poles of the world, but differ in their motion uponthe poles of the Zodiac.Tush, these slender trifles Wagner can decide,Hath Mephistopheles no greater skill?Who knows not the double motion of the planets?The first is finished in a natural day,The second thus, as Saturn in 30. years, Jupiter in 12.Mars in 4. the Sun, Venus, and Mercury in a year: theMoon in 28. days.
