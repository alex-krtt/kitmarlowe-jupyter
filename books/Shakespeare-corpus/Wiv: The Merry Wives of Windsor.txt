Sir Hugh, persuade me not. I will make a
Star-Chamber matter of it. If he were twenty Sir
John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow,
Esquire.
In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace
and Coram.
Ay, Cousin Slender, and Custalorum.
Ay, and Ratolorum too; and a gentleman born,
Master Parson, who writes himself Armigero
in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation—
Armigero!
Ay, that I do, and have done any time these
three hundred years.
All his successors gone before him hath
done ’t, and all his ancestors that come after him
may. They may give the dozen white luces in their
coat.
It is an old coat.
The dozen white louses do become an old
coat well. It agrees well, passant. It is a familiar
beast to man and signifies love.
The luce is the fresh fish. The salt fish is an
old coat.
I may quarter, coz.
You may, by marrying.
It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.
Not a whit.
Yes, py ’r Lady. If he has a quarter of your
coat, there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
simple conjectures. But that is all one. If Sir John
Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you,
I am of the Church, and will be glad to do my
benevolence to make atonements and compromises
between you.
The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.
It is not meet the Council hear a riot. There
is no fear of Got in a riot. The Council, look you,
shall desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear
a riot. Take your visaments in that.
Ha! O’ my life, if I were young again, the
sword should end it.
It is petter that friends is the sword, and end
it. And there is also another device in my prain,
which peradventure prings goot discretions with
it. There is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master
Thomas Page, which is pretty virginity.
Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair
and speaks small like a woman?
It is that fery person for all the ’orld, as just
as you will desire. And seven hundred pounds of
moneys, and gold, and silver, is her grandsire upon
his death’s-bed (Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!)
give, when she is able to overtake seventeen
years old. It were a goot motion if we leave our
pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage between
Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.
Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred
pound?
Ay, and her father is make her a petter
penny.
I know the young gentlewoman. She has
good gifts.
Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is
goot gifts.
Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff
there?
Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I
do despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
is not true. The knight Sir John is there, and I beseech
you be ruled by your well-willers. I will peat
the door for Master Page. What ho?
Got pless your house here.
Who’s there?
Here is Got’s plessing, and your friend, and
Justice Shallow, and here young Master Slender,
that peradventures shall tell you another tale, if
matters grow to your likings.
I am glad to see your Worships well. I thank you
for my venison, Master Shallow.
Master Page, I am glad to see you. Much
good do it your good heart! I wished your venison
better; it was ill killed. How doth good Mistress
Page? And I thank you always with my heart, la,
with my heart.
Sir, I thank you.
Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.
I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.
How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I
heard say he was outrun on Cotsall.
It could not be judged, sir.
You’ll not confess, you’ll not confess.
That he will not. ’Tis your fault, ’tis your
fault. ’Tis a good dog.
A cur, sir.
Sir, he’s a good dog and a fair dog. Can there
be more said? He is good and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff
here?
Sir, he is within, and I would I could do a good
office between you.
It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.
He hath wronged me, Master Page.
Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.
If it be confessed, it is not redressed. Is not
that so, Master Page? He hath wronged me, indeed
he hath; at a word, he hath. Believe me. Robert
Shallow, Esquire, saith he is wronged.
Here comes Sir John.
Now, Master Shallow, you’ll complain of me
to the King?
Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my
deer, and broke open my lodge.
But not kissed your keeper’s daughter.
Tut, a pin. This shall be answered.
I will answer it straight: I have done all this.
That is now answered.
The Council shall know this.
’Twere better for you if it were known in
counsel. You’ll be laughed at.
Pauca verba, Sir John, good worts.
Good worts? Good cabbage!—Slender, I
broke your head. What matter have you against
me?
Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against
you and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
Nym, and Pistol.
You Banbury cheese!
Ay, it is no matter.
How now, Mephostophilus?
Ay, it is no matter.
Slice, I say! Pauca, pauca. Slice, that’s my humor.
Where’s Simple, my man?
Can you tell, cousin?
Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand;
there is three umpires in this matter, as I understand:
that is, Master Page (fidelicet Master Page);
and there is myself (fidelicet myself); and the three
party is, lastly and finally, mine Host of the Garter.
We three to hear it and end it between them.
Fery goot. I will make a prief of it in my
notebook, and we will afterwards ’ork upon the
cause with as great discreetly as we can.
Pistol.
He hears with ears.
The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this,
He hears with ear? Why, it is affectations.
Pistol, did you pick Master Slender’s purse?
Ay, by these gloves, did he—or I would I
might never come in mine own great chamber
again else—of seven groats in mill-sixpences,
and two Edward shovel-boards that cost me two
shilling and twopence apiece of Yed Miller, by
these gloves.
Is this true, Pistol?
No, it is false, if it is a pickpurse.
Ha, thou mountain foreigner!—Sir John and
master mine, I combat challenge of this latten
bilbo.—Word of denial in thy labras here! Word of
denial! Froth and scum, thou liest.
By these gloves, then ’twas
he.
Be avised, sir, and pass good humors. I will say
marry trap with you if you run the nuthook’s
humor on me. That is the very note of it.
By this hat, then, he in the red face had it.
For, though I cannot remember what I did when
you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an
ass.
What say you, Scarlet and John?
Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman
had drunk himself out of his five sentences.
It is his five senses. Fie, what the ignorance
is!
And being fap, sir, was, as
they say, cashiered. And so conclusions passed the
careers.
Ay, you spake in Latin then too. But ’tis no
matter. I’ll ne’er be drunk whilst I live again but in
honest, civil, godly company, for this trick. If I be
drunk, I’ll be drunk with those that have the fear of
God, and not with drunken knaves.
So Got ’udge me, that is a virtuous mind.
You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen.
You hear it.
Nay, daughter, carry the wine in. We’ll drink
within.
O heaven, this is Mistress Anne Page.
How now, Mistress Ford?
Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well
met. By your leave, good mistress.
Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome.—Come, we
have a hot venison pasty to dinner. Come, gentlemen,
I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.
I had rather than forty shillings I had my
book of Songs and Sonnets here!
How now, Simple? Where have you been? I must
wait on myself, must I? You have not the Book of
Riddles about you, have you?
Book of Riddles? Why, did you not lend it to
Alice Shortcake upon Allhallowmas last, a fortnight
afore Michaelmas?
Come, coz; come, coz. We stay
for you. A word with you, coz. Marry, this, coz:
there is, as ’twere, a tender, a kind of tender, made
afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do you understand me?
Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable. If it be
so, I shall do that that is reason.
Nay, but understand me.
So I do, sir.
Give ear to his motions, Master Slender. I
will description the matter to you, if you be capacity
of it.
Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I
pray you, pardon me. He’s a Justice of Peace in his
country, simple though I stand here.
But that is not the question. The question is
concerning your marriage.
Ay, there’s the point, sir.
Marry, is it, the very point of it—to Mistress
Anne Page.
Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
reasonable demands.
But can you affection the ’oman? Let us command
to know that of your mouth, or of your lips;
for divers philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of
the mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
good will to the maid?
Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one
that would do reason.
Nay, Got’s lords and His ladies! You must
speak positable, if you can carry her your desires
towards her.
That you must. Will you, upon good dowry,
marry her?
I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
request, cousin, in any reason.
Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz.
What I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the
maid?
I will marry her, sir, at your request. But if
there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven
may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when
we are married and have more occasion to know
one another. I hope upon familiarity will grow
more content. But if you say Marry her, I will
marry her. That I am freely dissolved, and
dissolutely.
It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is
in the ’ord dissolutely. The ’ort is, according to
our meaning, resolutely. His meaning is good.
Ay, I think my cousin meant well.
Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!
Here comes fair Mistress Anne.—Would I
were young for your sake, Mistress Anne.
The dinner is on the table. My father desires
your Worships’ company.
I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.
’Od’s plessèd will, I will not be absence at
the grace.
Will ’t please your Worship to come
in, sir?
No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily. I am very
well.
The dinner attends you, sir.
I am not ahungry, I thank you, forsooth.
Go, sirrah, for all you are my man, go
wait upon my cousin Shallow. A
Justice of Peace sometime may be beholding to his
friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
yet, till my mother be dead. But what though? Yet
I live like a poor gentleman born.
I may not go in without your Worship. They will
not sit till you come.
I’ faith, I’ll eat nothing. I thank you as much
as though I did.
I pray you, sir, walk in.
I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
my shin th’ other day with playing at sword and
dagger with a master of fence—three veneys for a
dish of stewed prunes—and, by my troth, I cannot
abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
dogs bark so? Be there bears i’ th’ town?
I think there are, sir. I heard them talked of.
I love the sport well, but I shall as soon quarrel
at it as any man in England. You are afraid if
you see the bear loose, are you not?
Ay, indeed, sir.
That’s meat and drink to me, now. I have
seen Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken
him by the chain. But, I warrant you, the women
have so cried and shrieked at it that it passed. But
women, indeed, cannot abide ’em; they are very ill-favored
rough things.
Come, gentle Master Slender, come. We stay for
you.
I’ll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.
By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! Come,
come.
Nay, pray you, lead the way.
Come on, sir.
Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
Not I, sir. Pray you, keep on.
Truly, I will not go first, truly, la! I will not do
you that wrong.
I pray you, sir.
I’ll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!
Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius’
house which is the way. And there dwells one Mistress
Quickly, which is in the manner of his nurse,
or his dry nurse, or his cook, or his laundry—his
washer and his wringer.
Well, sir.
Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter
for it is a ’oman that altogether’s
acquaintance with Mistress Anne Page;
and the letter is to desire and require her to solicit
your master’s desires to Mistress Anne Page. I pray
you, be gone. I will make an end of my dinner;
there’s pippins and cheese to come.
Mine Host of the Garter!
What says my bullyrook? Speak scholarly and
wisely.
Truly, mine Host, I must turn away some of
my followers.
Discard, bully Hercules, cashier. Let them wag;
trot, trot.
I sit at ten pounds a week.
Thou ’rt an emperor—Caesar, Keiser, and
Pheazar. I will entertain Bardolph. He shall draw,
he shall tap. Said I well, bully Hector?
Do so, good mine Host.
I have spoke. Let him follow.—Let me see thee
froth and lime. I am at a word. Follow.
Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good
trade. An old cloak makes a new jerkin, a withered
servingman a fresh tapster. Go. Adieu.
It is a life that I have desired. I will thrive.
O base Hungarian wight, wilt thou the spigot
wield?
He was gotten in drink. Is not the humor
conceited?
I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox.
His thefts were too open. His filching was like an
unskillful singer; he kept not time.
The good humor is to steal at a minute’s rest.
Convey, the wise it call. Steal? Foh, a fico
for the phrase!
Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.
Why, then, let kibes ensue.
There is no remedy. I must cony-catch, I
must shift.
Young ravens must have food.
Which of you know Ford of this town?
I ken the wight. He is of substance good.
My honest lads, I will tell you what I am
about.
Two yards and more.
No quips now, Pistol. Indeed, I am in the
waist two yards about, but I am now about no
waste; I am about thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make
love to Ford’s wife. I spy entertainment in her. She
discourses; she carves; she gives the leer of invitation.
I can construe the action of her familiar style;
and the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
rightly, is I am Sir John Falstaff’s.
He hath studied her will and
translated her will—out of honesty into English.
The anchor is deep. Will that
humor pass?
Now, the report goes, she has all the rule of
her husband’s purse. He hath a legion of angels.
As many devils entertain, and
To her, boy, say I.
The humor rises; it is good.
Humor me the angels.
I have writ me here a
letter to her; and here another to Page’s wife, who
even now gave me good eyes too, examined my
parts with most judicious oeillades. Sometimes
the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes
my portly belly.
Then did the sun on dunghill
shine.
I thank thee for that humor.
O, she did so course o’er my exteriors with
such a greedy intention that the appetite of her
eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass.
Here’s another letter to her. She bears the purse
too; she is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty.
I will be cheaters to them both, and they shall be
exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
this letter to Mistress Page—and thou this to Mistress
Ford. We will thrive, lads, we will thrive.
Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
And by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!
I will run no base humor. Here, take
the humor-letter. I will keep the havior of
reputation.
Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.—
Rogues, hence, avaunt, vanish like hailstones, go,
Trudge, plod away i’ th’ hoof, seek shelter, pack!
Falstaff will learn the humor of the age:
French thrift, you rogues—myself and skirted page.
Let vultures gripe thy guts! For gourd and fullam
holds,
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor.
Tester I’ll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
Base Phrygian Turk!
I have operations which be humors of revenge.
Wilt thou revenge?
By welkin and her star!
With wit or steel?
With both the humors, I. I will discuss the
humor of this love to Ford.
And I to Page shall eke unfold
How Falstaff, varlet vile,
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
And his soft couch defile.
My humor shall not cool. I will incense Ford to
deal with poison. I will possess him with yellowness,
for the revolt of mine is dangerous. That is
my true humor.
Thou art the Mars of malcontents. I second
thee. Troop on.
What, John Rugby!
I pray thee, go to the casement and see if
you can see my master, Master Doctor Caius, coming.
If he do, i’ faith, and find anybody in the
house, here will be an old abusing of God’s patience
and the King’s English.
I’ll go watch.
Go, and we’ll have a posset for ’t
soon at night, in faith, at the latter end of a seacoal
fire. An honest, willing, kind fellow
as ever servant shall come in house withal; and, I
warrant you, no telltale nor no breed-bate. His
worst fault is that he is given to prayer. He is something
peevish that way, but nobody but has his
fault. But let that pass. Peter Simple you say your
name is?
Ay, for fault of a better.
And Master Slender’s your master?
Ay, forsooth.
Does he not wear a great round
beard like a glover’s paring knife?
No, forsooth. He hath but a little wee face,
with a little yellow beard, a Cain-colored beard.
A softly-sprited man, is he not?
Ay, forsooth. But he is as tall a man of his
hands as any is between this and his head. He hath
fought with a warrener.
How say you? O, I should remember
him. Does he not hold up his head, as it were,
and strut in his gait?
Yes, indeed, does he.
Well, heaven send Anne Page no
worse fortune! Tell Master Parson Evans I will do
what I can for your master. Anne is a good girl, and
I wish—
Out, alas! Here comes my master.
We shall all be shent.—Run in here,
good young man. Go into this closet. He will not
stay long. What, John Rugby!
John! What, John, I say! Go, John, go enquire for
my master. I doubt he be not well, that he comes
not home.
And down, down, adown ’a, etc.
Vat is you sing? I do not like dese toys.
Pray you, go and vetch me in my closet un boîtier
vert, a box, a green-a box. Do intend vat I speak?
A green-a box.
Ay, forsooth. I’ll fetch it you.
I am glad he went not in himself. If he
had found the young man, he would have been
horn-mad.
Fe, fe, fe, fe! Ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je
m’en vais à la cour—la grande affaire.
Is it this, sir?
Oui, mets-le à mon pocket. Dépêche,
quickly. Vere is dat knave Rugby?
What, John Rugby, John!
Here, sir.
You are John Rugby, and you are Jack
Rugby. Come, take-a your rapier, and come after
my heel to the court.
’Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.
By my trot, I tarry too long. Od’s
me! Qu’ai-j’oublié? Dere is some simples in my
closet dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave
behind.
Ay me! He’ll find the young man
there, and be mad!
O diable, diable! Vat is in my closet? Villainy!
Larron! Rugby, my
rapier!
Good master, be content.
Wherefore shall I be content-a?
The young man is an honest man.
What shall de honest man do in my
closet? Dere is no honest man dat shall come in
my closet.
I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic.
Hear the truth of it. He came of an errand to me
from Parson Hugh.
Vell?
Ay, forsooth. To desire her to—
Peace, I pray you.
Peace-a your tongue.—Speak-a your
tale.
To desire this honest gentlewoman, your
maid, to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page
for my master in the way of marriage.
This is all, indeed, la! But I’ll ne’er
put my finger in the fire, and need not.
Sir Hugh send-a you?—
Rugby, baille me some paper.—Tarry you a little-a
while.
I am glad he is so
quiet. If he had been throughly moved, you should
have heard him so loud and so melancholy. But
notwithstanding, man, I’ll do you your master
what good I can. And the very yea and the no is,
the French doctor, my master—I may call him my
master, look you, for I keep his house, and I wash,
wring, brew, bake, scour, dress meat and drink,
make the beds, and do all myself—
’Tis a great charge to come
under one body’s hand.
Are you advised o’
that? You shall find it a great charge. And to be up
early and down late. But notwithstanding—to tell
you in your ear; I would have no words of it—my
master himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page.
But notwithstanding that, I know Anne’s mind.
That’s neither here nor there.
You, jack’nape,
give-a this letter to Sir Hugh. By gar, it is a
shallenge. I will cut his troat in de park, and I will
teach a scurvy jackanape priest to meddle or
make. You may be gone. It is not good you tarry
here.—By gar, I will cut all his two stones. By gar,
he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog.
Alas, he speaks but for his friend.
It is no matter-a ver dat. Do not you tell-a
me dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I
vill kill de jack priest; and I have appointed mine
Host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar,
I will myself have Anne Page.
Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall
be well. We must give folks leave to prate. What
the goodyear!
Rugby, come to the court with me.
By gar, if I have not Anne Page,
I shall turn your head out of my door.—Follow my
heels, Rugby.
You shall have Anne—
fool’s head of your own. No, I know Anne’s mind
for that. Never a woman in Windsor knows more
of Anne’s mind than I do, nor can do more than I
do with her, I thank heaven.
Who’s within there, ho?
Who’s there, I trow? Come near the
house, I pray you.
How now, good woman? How dost thou?
The better that it pleases your good
Worship to ask.
What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?
In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and
honest, and gentle; and one that is your friend, I
can tell you that by the way, I praise heaven for it.
Shall I do any good, think’st thou? Shall I not
lose my suit?
Troth, sir, all is in His hands above.
But notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I’ll be sworn
on a book she loves you. Have not your Worship a
wart above your eye?
Yes, marry, have I. What of that?
Well, thereby hangs a tale. Good
faith, it is such another Nan! But, I detest, an honest
maid as ever broke bread. We had an hour’s
talk of that wart. I shall never laugh but in that
maid’s company. But, indeed, she is given too
much to allicholy and musing. But, for you,—well,
go to.
Well, I shall see her today. Hold, there’s
money for thee. Let me
have thy voice in my behalf. If thou see’st her before
me, commend me.
Will I? I’ faith, that we will. And I
will tell your Worship more of the wart the next
time we have confidence, and of other wooers.
Well, farewell. I am in great haste now.
Farewell to your Worship.
Truly an honest gentleman—but Anne loves him
not, for I know Anne’s mind as well as another
does. Out upon ’t! What have I forgot?
What, have I ’scaped love letters in
the holiday time of my beauty, and am I now a
subject for them? Let me see.
Ask me no reason why I love you, for though Love
use Reason for his precisian, he admits him not for
his counselor. You are not young; no more am I. Go
to, then, there’s sympathy. You are merry; so am I.
Ha, ha, then, there’s more sympathy. You love sack,
and so do I. Would you desire better sympathy? Let
it suffice thee, Mistress Page—at the least, if the love
of soldier can suffice—that I love thee. I will not say
pity me—’tis not a soldier-like phrase—but I say love
me. By me,
Thine own true knight,
By day or night,
Or any kind of light,
With all his might
For thee to fight,
John Falstaff.
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
age, to show himself a young gallant! What an
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
picked—with the devil’s name!—out of my conversation,
that he dares in this manner assay me?
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company!
What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
mirth. Heaven forgive me! Why, I’ll exhibit a bill
in the Parliament for the putting down of men.
How shall I be revenged on him? For revenged I
will be, as sure as his guts are made of puddings.
Mistress Page! Trust me, I was going to
your house.
And, trust me, I was coming to you.
You look very ill.
Nay, I’ll ne’er believe that. I have to
show to the contrary.
Faith, but you do, in my mind.
Well, I do, then. Yet I say I could show
you to the contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some
counsel.
What’s the matter, woman?
O woman, if it were not for one trifling
respect, I could come to such honor!
Hang the trifle, woman; take the honor.
What is it? Dispense with trifles. What is it?
If I would but go to hell for an eternal
moment or so, I could be knighted.
What, thou liest! Sir Alice Ford? These
knights will hack, and so thou shouldst not alter
the article of thy gentry.
We burn daylight. Here, read, read. Perceive
how I might be knighted.
I shall think the
worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make
difference of men’s liking. And yet he would not
swear; praised women’s modesty; and gave such
orderly and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness
that I would have sworn his disposition
would have gone to the truth of his words. But
they do no more adhere and keep place together
than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of
Greensleeves. What tempest, I trow, threw this
whale, with so many tuns of oil in his belly, ashore
at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I
think the best way were to entertain him with hope
till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his
own grease. Did you ever hear the like?
Letter for letter, but that the name of
Page and Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this
mystery of ill opinions, here’s the twin brother of
thy letter.
But let thine inherit first, for I protest
mine never shall. I warrant he hath a thousand of
these letters writ with blank space for different
names—sure, more—and these are of the second
edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he
cares not what he puts into the press, when he
would put us two. I had rather be a giantess and lie
under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you twenty
lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.
Why, this is the very same—the very
hand, the very words. What doth he think of us?
Nay, I know not. It makes me almost
ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I’ll entertain
myself like one that I am not acquainted
withal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in
me that I know not myself, he would never have
boarded me in this fury.
Boarding call you it? I’ll be sure to
keep him above deck.
So will I. If he come under my hatches,
I’ll never to sea again. Let’s be revenged on him.
Let’s appoint him a meeting, give him a show of
comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited
delay till he hath pawned his horses to mine
Host of the Garter.
Nay, I will consent to act any villainy
against him that may not sully the chariness of our
honesty. O, that my husband saw this letter! It
would give eternal food to his jealousy.
Why, look where he comes, and my
good man too. He’s as far from jealousy as I am
from giving him cause, and that, I hope, is an
unmeasurable distance.
You are the happier woman.
Let’s consult together against this greasy
knight. Come hither.
Well, I hope it be not so.
Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs.
Sir John affects thy wife.
Why, sir, my wife is not young.
He woos both high and low, both rich and poor,
Both young and old, one with another, Ford.
He loves the gallimaufry. Ford, perpend.
Love my wife?
With liver burning hot. Prevent,
Or go thou like Sir Acteon, he,
With Ringwood at thy heels.
O, odious is the name!
What name, sir?
The horn, I say. Farewell.
Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by
night.
Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo birds do
sing.—
Away, Sir Corporal Nym.—Believe it, Page. He
speaks sense.
I will be patient. I will find out this.
And this is true. I like not the humor of
lying. He hath wronged me in some humors. I
should have borne the humored letter to her; but I
have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity.
He loves your wife; there’s the short and the long.
My name is Corporal Nym. I speak and I avouch.
’Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your
wife. Adieu. I love not the humor of bread and
cheese. Adieu.
The humor of it, quoth he? Here’s a fellow
frights English out of his wits.
I will seek out Falstaff.
I never heard such a drawling, affecting
rogue.
If I do find it—well.
I will not believe such a Cataian, though
the priest o’ th’ town commended him for a true
man.
’Twas a good sensible fellow—well.
How now, Meg?
Whither go you, George? Hark you.
How now, sweet Frank? Why
art thou melancholy?
I melancholy? I am not melancholy. Get you
home. Go.
Faith, thou hast some crochets in thy
head now.—Will you go, Mistress Page?
Have with you.—You’ll come to dinner,
George? Look who
comes yonder.
She shall be our messenger to this paltry knight.
Trust me, I thought on her. She’ll fit it.
You are come to
see my daughter Anne?
Ay, forsooth. And, I pray, how does
good Mistress Anne?
Go in with us and see. We have an
hour’s talk with you.
How now, Master Ford?
You heard what this knave told me, did you not?
Yes, and you heard what the other told me?
Do you think there is truth in them?
Hang ’em, slaves! I do not think the knight
would offer it. But these that accuse him in his intent
towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded
men, very rogues, now they be out of service.
Were they his men?
Marry, were they.
I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at
the Garter?
Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage
toward my wife, I would turn her loose to him;
and what he gets more of her than sharp words, let
it lie on my head.
I do not misdoubt my wife, but I would be loath
to turn them together. A man may be too confident.
I would have nothing lie on my head. I cannot
be thus satisfied.
Look where my ranting Host of the Garter
comes. There is either liquor in his pate or money
in his purse when he looks so merrily.—How now,
mine Host?
How now, bullyrook? Thou ’rt a gentleman.—
Cavaleiro Justice, I say!
I follow, mine Host, I follow.—Good even
and twenty, good Master Page. Master Page, will
you go with us? We have sport in hand.
Tell him, Cavaleiro Justice; tell him, bullyrook.
Sir, there is a fray to be fought between
Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French
doctor.
Good mine Host o’ th’ Garter, a word with you.
What say’st thou, my bullyrook?
Will you go with us to behold it?
My merry Host hath had the measuring of their
weapons and, I think, hath appointed them contrary
places; for, believe me, I hear the parson is no
jester. Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.
Hast thou no suit against my knight,
my guest cavalier?
None, I protest. But I’ll give you a pottle of
burnt sack to give me recourse to him, and tell him
my name is Brook—only for a jest.
My hand, bully. Thou shalt have egress and
regress—said I well?—and thy name shall be
Brook. It is a merry knight.
Will you go, ameers?
Have with you, mine Host.
I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill
in his rapier.
Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these
times you stand on distance—your passes, stoccados,
and I know not what. ’Tis the heart, Master
Page; ’tis here, ’tis here. I have seen the time, with
my long sword I would have made you four tall
fellows skip like rats.
Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?
Have with you. I had rather hear them scold
than fight.
Though Page be a secure fool and stands so
firmly on his wife’s frailty, yet I cannot put off my
opinion so easily. She was in his company at Page’s
house, and what they made there I know not. Well,
I will look further into ’t, and I have a disguise to
sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not my
labor. If she be otherwise, ’tis labor well bestowed.
I will not lend thee a penny.
Why then, the world’s mine oyster, which I
with sword will open.
Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you
should lay my countenance to pawn. I have grated
upon my good friends for three reprieves for you
and your coach-fellow Nym, or else you had
looked through the grate like a gemini of baboons.
I am damned in hell for swearing to gentlemen my
friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows.
And when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her
fan, I took ’t upon mine honor thou hadst it not.
Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen
pence?
Reason, you rogue, reason. Think’st thou I’ll
endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more
about me. I am no gibbet for you. Go—a short
knife and a throng—to your manor of Pickt-hatch,
go. You’ll not bear a letter for me, you rogue? You
stand upon your honor? Why, thou unconfinable
baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the
terms of my honor precise. Ay, ay, I myself sometimes,
leaving the fear of God on the left hand
and hiding mine honor in my necessity, am fain to
shuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,
will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain
looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your bold beating
oaths under the shelter of your honor! You will
not do it? You?
I do relent. What would thou more of man?
Sir, here’s a woman would speak with you.
Let her approach.
Give your Worship good morrow.
Good morrow, goodwife.
Not so, an ’t please your Worship.
Good maid, then.
I’ll be sworn—as my mother was,
the first hour I was born.
I do believe the swearer. What with me?
Shall I vouchsafe your Worship a
word or two?
Two thousand, fair woman, and I’ll vouchsafe
thee the hearing.
There is one Mistress Ford, sir—I
pray, come a little nearer this ways. I myself dwell
with Master Doctor Caius.
Well, on. Mistress Ford, you say—
Your Worship says very true. I pray
your Worship, come a little nearer this ways.
I warrant thee, nobody hears. Mine own
people, mine own people.
Are they so? God bless them and
make them His servants!
Well, Mistress Ford—what of her?
Why, sir, she’s a good creature.
Lord, Lord, your Worship’s a wanton! Well, heaven
forgive you and all of us, I pray!
Mistress Ford—come, Mistress Ford—
Marry, this is the short and the long
of it: you have brought her into such a canaries as
’tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when
the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought
her to such a canary. Yet there has been knights,
and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I
warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter,
gift after gift, smelling so sweetly—all musk—and
so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in
such alligant terms, and in such wine and sugar of
the best and the fairest, that would have won any
woman’s heart; and, I warrant you, they could
never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty
angels given me this morning, but I defy all angels
in any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
honesty. And, I warrant you, they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
them all. And yet there has been earls—nay, which
is more, pensioners—but, I warrant you, all is one
with her.
But what says she to me? Be brief, my good
she-Mercury.
Marry, she hath received your letter,
for the which she thanks you a thousand times,
and she gives you to notify that her husband will
be absence from his house between ten and eleven.
Ten and eleven?
Ay, forsooth; and then you may come
and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master
Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas, the
sweet woman leads an ill life with him. He’s a very
jealousy man. She leads a very frampold life with
him, good heart.
Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to
her. I will not fail her.
Why, you say well. But I have another
messenger to your Worship. Mistress Page
hath her hearty commendations to you too; and,
let me tell you in your ear, she’s as fartuous a civil
modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss
you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor,
whoe’er be the other. And she bade me tell
your Worship that her husband is seldom from
home, but she hopes there will come a time. I
never knew a woman so dote upon a man. Surely, I
think you have charms, la! Yes, in truth.
Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of
my good parts aside, I have no other charms.
Blessing on your heart for ’t!
But I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford’s wife
and Page’s wife acquainted each other how they
love me?
That were a jest indeed! They have
not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed!
But Mistress Page would desire you to send her
your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a
marvelous infection to the little page; and, truly,
Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
Windsor leads a better life than she does. Do what
she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to
bed when she list, rise when she list—all is as she
will. And, truly, she deserves it, for if there be a
kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send
her your page, no remedy.
Why, I will.
Nay, but do so then, and, look you,
he may come and go between you both. And in any
case have a nayword, that you may know one another’s
mind, and the boy never need to understand
anything; for ’tis not good that children
should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know,
have discretion, as they say, and know the world.
Fare thee well. Commend me to them both.
There’s my purse. I am yet
thy debtor.—Boy, go along with this woman.
This news distracts
me.
This punk is one of Cupid’s carriers.
Clap on more sails, pursue; up with your fights;
Give fire! She is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!
Sayst thou so, old Jack? Go thy ways. I’ll
make more of thy old body than I have done. Will
they yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense
of so much money, be now a gainer? Good
body, I thank thee. Let them say ’tis grossly done;
so it be fairly done, no matter.
Sir John, there’s one Master Brook below
would fain speak with you and be acquainted with
you, and hath sent your Worship a morning’s
draught of sack.
Brook is his name?
Ay, sir.
Call him in. Such Brooks are welcome to
me that o’erflows such liquor.
Ah ha, Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompassed
you? Go to. Via!
God bless you, sir.
And you, sir. Would you speak with me?
I make bold to press with so little
preparation upon you.
You’re welcome. What’s your will?—Give us
leave, drawer.
Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent
much. My name is Brook.
Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance
of you.
Good Sir John, I sue for yours—not
to charge you, for I must let you understand I
think myself in better plight for a lender than you
are, the which hath something emboldened me to
this unseasoned intrusion; for they say, if money
go before, all ways do lie open.
Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.
Troth, and I have a bag of money
here troubles me. If you will help
to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me
of the carriage.
Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your
porter.
I will tell you, sir, if you will give me
the hearing.
Speak, good Master Brook. I shall be glad
to be your servant.
Sir, I hear you are a scholar—I will
be brief with you—and you have been a man long
known to me, though I had never so good means
as desire to make myself acquainted with you. I
shall discover a thing to you wherein I must very
much lay open mine own imperfection. But, good
Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as
you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register
of your own, that I may pass with a reproof
the easier, sith you yourself know how easy it is to
be such an offender.
Very well, sir. Proceed.
There is a gentlewoman in this
town—her husband’s name is Ford.
Well, sir.
I have long loved her and, I protest
to you, bestowed much on her, followed her with
a doting observance, engrossed opportunities to
meet her, fee’d every slight occasion that could but
niggardly give me sight of her, not only bought
many presents to give her, but have given largely to
many to know what she would have given. Briefly,
I have pursued her as love hath pursued me, which
hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever
I have merited, either in my mind or in my
means, meed I am sure I have received none, unless
experience be a jewel. That I have purchased
at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say
this:
Love like a shadow flies when substance love
pursues,
Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.
Have you received no promise of satisfaction
at her hands?
Never.
Have you importuned her to such a
purpose?
Never.
Of what quality was your love, then?
Like a fair house built on another
man’s ground, so that I have lost my edifice by
mistaking the place where I erected it.
To what purpose have you unfolded this to
me?
When I have told you that, I have
told you all. Some say that though she appear honest
to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her
mirth so far that there is shrewd construction
made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my
purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding,
admirable discourse, of great admittance,
authentic in your place and person, generally
allowed for your many warlike, courtlike, and
learned preparations.
O, sir!
Believe it, for you know it. There is
money. Spend it, spend
it, spend more; spend all I have. Only give me so
much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an
amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford’s wife.
Use your art of wooing; win her to consent to you.
If any man may, you may as soon as any.
Would it apply well to the vehemency of
your affection that I should win what you would
enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very
preposterously.
O, understand my drift. She dwells
so securely on the excellency of her honor that the
folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too
bright to be looked against. Now, could I come to
her with any detection in my hand, my desires had
instance and argument to commend themselves. I
could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand
other her defenses, which now are too too strongly
embattled against me. What say you to ’t, Sir
John?
Master Brook, I will first
make bold with your money; next, give me your
hand; and, last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if
you will, enjoy Ford’s wife.
O, good sir!
I say you shall.
Want no money, Sir John; you shall
want none.
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you
shall want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you,
by her own appointment. Even as you came in to
me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I
say I shall be with her between ten and eleven, for
at that time the jealous, rascally knave her husband
will be forth. Come you to me at night. You
shall know how I speed.
I am blessed in your acquaintance.
Do you know Ford, sir?
Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know
him not. Yet I wrong him to call him poor. They
say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of
money, for the which his wife seems to me well-favored.
I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly
rogue’s coffer, and there’s my harvest home.
I would you knew Ford, sir, that you
might avoid him if you saw him.
Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I
will stare him out of his wits. I will awe him with
my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o’er the
cuckold’s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford’s
a knave, and I will aggravate his style. Thou, Master
Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold.
Come to me soon at night.
What a damned epicurean rascal is this! My
heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says
this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent
to him, the hour is fixed, the match is made.
Would any man have thought this? See the hell of
having a false woman: my bed shall be abused, my
coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at. And
I shall not only receive this villainous wrong but
stand under the adoption of abominable terms,
and by him that does me this wrong. Terms,
names! Amaimon sounds well, Lucifer well,
Barbason well; yet they are devils’ additions, the
names of fiends. But Cuckold, Wittoll, Cuckold!
The devil himself hath not such a name. Page
is an ass, a secure ass. He will trust his wife, he will
not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with
my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my
cheese, an Irishman with my aquavitae bottle, or
a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife
with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates,
then she devises; and what they think in their
hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts
but they will effect. God be praised for my jealousy!
Eleven o’clock the hour. I will prevent this,
detect my wife, be revenged on Falstaff, and laugh
at Page. I will about it. Better three hours too soon
than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! Cuckold, cuckold,
cuckold!
Jack Rugby.
Sir?
Vat is the clock, Jack?
’Tis past the hour, sir, that Sir Hugh promised
to meet.
By gar, he has save his soul dat he is no
come. He has pray his Pible well dat he is no come.
By gar, Jack Rugby, he is dead already if he be
come.
He is wise, sir. He knew your Worship would
kill him if he came.
By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill
kill him. Take your rapier, Jack. I vill tell you how I
vill kill him.
Alas, sir, I cannot fence.
Villainy, take your rapier.
Forbear. Here’s company.
God bless thee, bully doctor!
God save you, Master Doctor Caius!
Now, good Master Doctor!
Give you good morrow, sir.
Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come
for?
To see thee fight, to see thee foin, to see thee traverse;
to see thee here, to see thee there; to see
thy pass, thy puncto, thy stock, thy reverse, thy
distance, thy montant. Is he dead, my Ethiopian?
Is he dead, my Francisco? Ha, bully? What says
my Aesculapius, my Galien, my heart of elder, ha?
Is he dead, bully stale? Is he dead?
By gar, he is de coward jack-priest of de
vorld. He is not show his face.
Thou art a Castalion King Urinal Hector of
Greece, my boy!
I pray you, bear witness that me have
stay six or seven, two, tree hours for him, and he is
no come.
He is the wiser man, Master Doctor. He is a
curer of souls, and you a curer of bodies. If you
should fight, you go against the hair of your professions.—
Is it not true, Master Page?
Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great
fighter, though now a man of peace.
Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old
and of the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger
itches to make one. Though we are justices and
doctors and churchmen, Master Page, we have
some salt of our youth in us. We are the sons of
women, Master Page.
’Tis true, Master Shallow.
It will be found so, Master Page.—Master
Doctor Caius, I am come to fetch you home. I am
sworn of the peace. You have showed yourself a
wise physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself
a wise and patient churchman. You must go with
me, Master Doctor.
Pardon, guest Justice. A word,
Monsieur Mockwater.
Mockvater? Vat is dat?
Mockwater, in our English tongue, is valor,
bully.
By gar, then I have as much mockvater
as de Englishman. Scurvy jack-dog priest! By gar,
me vill cut his ears.
He will clapper-claw thee tightly, bully.
Clapper-de-claw? Vat is dat?
That is, he will make thee amends.
By gar, me do look he shall clapper-de-claw
me, for, by gar, me vill have it.
And I will provoke him to ’t, or let him wag.
Me tank you for dat.
And moreover, bully—
But first, Master guest, and
Master Page, and eke Cavaleiro Slender, go you
through the town to Frogmore.
Sir Hugh is there, is he?
He is there. See what humor he is in; and I will
bring the doctor about by the fields. Will it do
well?
We will do it.
Adieu, good Master
Doctor.
By gar, me vill kill de priest, for he speak
for a jackanape to Anne Page.
Let him die. Sheathe thy impatience; throw cold
water on thy choler. Go about the fields with me
through Frogmore. I will bring thee where Mistress
Anne Page is, at a farmhouse a-feasting, and
thou shalt woo her. Cried game! Said I well?
By gar, me dank you vor dat. By gar, I
love you, and I shall procure-a you de good guest:
de earl, de knight, de lords, de gentlemen, my
patients.
For the which I will be thy adversary toward
Anne Page. Said I well?
By gar, ’tis good. Vell said.
Let us wag, then.
Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.
I pray you now, good Master Slender’s servingman
and friend Simple by your name, which
way have you looked for Master Caius, that calls
himself doctor of physic?
Marry, sir, the Petty-ward, the Park-ward,
every way; Old Windsor way, and every way but
the town way.
I most fehemently desire you, you will also
look that way.
I will, sir.
Pless my soul, how full of cholers I am, and
trempling of mind! I shall be glad if he have deceived
me. How melancholies I am! I will knog his
urinals about his knave’s costard when I have good
opportunities for the ’ork. Pless my soul!
To shallow rivers, to whose falls
Melodious birds sings madrigals.
There will we make our peds of roses
And a thousand fragrant posies.
To shallow—
Mercy on me, I have a great dispositions to cry.
Melodious birds sing madrigals—
Whenas I sat in Pabylon—
And a thousand vagram posies.
To shallow rivers, to whose falls
Melodious birds sings madrigals.
Yonder he is, coming this way, Sir Hugh.
He’s welcome.
To shallow rivers, to whose falls—
Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?
No weapons, sir. There comes my master,
Master Shallow, and another gentleman, from
Frogmore, over the stile, this way.
Pray you, give me my gown—or else keep it
in your arms.
How now, Master Parson? Good morrow,
good Sir Hugh. Keep a gamester from the dice,
and a good student from his book, and it is
wonderful.
Ah, sweet Anne Page!
God save you, good Sir Hugh!
God pless you from His mercy sake, all of
you!
What, the sword and the word? Do you
study them both, Master Parson?
And youthful still—in your doublet and hose
this raw rheumatic day?
There is reasons and causes for it.
We are come to you to do a good office, Master
Parson.
Fery well. What is it?
Yonder is a most reverend gentleman who, belike
having received wrong by some person, is at
most odds with his own gravity and patience that
ever you saw.
I have lived fourscore years and upward. I
never heard a man of his place, gravity, and learning
so wide of his own respect.
What is he?
I think you know him: Master Doctor Caius, the
renowned French physician.
Got’s will and His passion of my heart! I had
as lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.
Why?
He has no more knowledge in Hibbocrates
and Galen—and he is a knave besides, a cowardly
knave as you would desires to be acquainted
withal.
I warrant you, he’s the man should
fight with him.
O, sweet Anne Page!
It appears so by his weapons. Keep them
asunder. Here comes Doctor Caius.
Nay, good Master Parson, keep in your weapon.
So do you, good Master Doctor.
Disarm them, and let them question. Let them
keep their limbs whole and hack our English.
I pray you, let-a me speak
a word with your ear. Verefore vill you not
meet-a me?
Pray you, use your patience.
In good time.
By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog,
John ape.
Pray you, let us not be
laughing-stocks to other men’s humors. I desire
you in friendship, and I will one way or other
make you amends. By Jeshu, I will knog
your urinal about your knave’s cogscomb.
Diable! Jack Rugby, mine Host de Jarteer,
have I not stay for him to kill him? Have I not,
at de place I did appoint?
As I am a Christians soul, now look you, this
is the place appointed. I’ll be judgment by mine
Host of the Garter.
Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh,
soul-curer and body-curer!
Ay, dat is very good, excellent.
Peace, I say! Hear mine Host of the Garter. Am
I politic? Am I subtle? Am I a Machiavel? Shall I
lose my doctor? No, he gives me the potions and
the motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my
Sir Hugh? No, he gives me the proverbs and the
no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial;
so. Give me thy hand, celestial;
so. Boys of art, I have deceived you both. I
have directed you to wrong places. Your hearts are
mighty, your skins are whole, and let burnt sack be
the issue. Come, lay their
swords to pawn. Follow
me, lads of peace, follow, follow, follow.
Afore God, a mad Host. Follow, gentlemen,
follow.
O, sweet Anne Page!
Ha, do I perceive dat? Have you make-a
de sot of us, ha, ha?
This is well! He has made us his vloutingstog.
I desire you that we may be friends, and let
us knog our prains together to be revenge on this
same scall, scurvy, cogging companion, the Host of
the Garter.
By gar, with all my heart. He promise
to bring me where is Anne Page. By gar, he deceive
me too.
Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you,
follow.
Nay, keep your way, little gallant. You
were wont to be a follower, but now you are a
leader. Whether had you rather—lead mine eyes,
or eye your master’s heels?
I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man
than follow him like a dwarf.
O, you are a flattering boy! Now I see
you’ll be a courtier.
Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?
Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at
home?
Ay, and as idle as she may hang together, for
want of company. I think if your husbands were
dead, you two would marry.
Be sure of that—two other husbands.
Where had you this pretty weathercock?
I cannot tell what the dickens his name
is my husband had him of.—What do you call your
knight’s name, sirrah?
Sir John Falstaff.
Sir John Falstaff!
He, he. I can never hit on ’s name.
There is such a league between my goodman and
he. Is your wife at home indeed?
Indeed, she is.
By your leave, sir. I am sick till I see
her.
Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath
he any thinking? Sure they sleep; he hath no use
of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty
mile as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank
twelve score. He pieces out his wife’s inclination.
He gives her folly motion and advantage. And now
she’s going to my wife, and Falstaff’s boy with her.
A man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And
Falstaff’s boy with her! Good plots they are laid,
and our revolted wives share damnation together.
Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
the borrowed veil of modesty from the so-seeming
Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure
and willful Acteon, and to these violent proceedings
all my neighbors shall cry aim.
The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance
bids me search. There I shall find Falstaff. I
shall be rather praised for this than mocked, for it
is as positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
there. I will go.
Well met, Master Ford.
Trust me, a good knot. I have good cheer at
home, and I pray you all go with me.
I must excuse myself, Master Ford.
And so must I, sir. We have appointed to dine
with Mistress Anne, and I would not break with
her for more money than I’ll speak of.
We have lingered about a match between
Anne Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we
shall have our answer.
I hope I have your good will, Father Page.
You have, Master Slender. I stand wholly for
you.—But my wife, Master Doctor, is for you
altogether.
Ay, be-gar, and de maid is love-a me! My
nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush.
What say you to young Master Fenton?
He capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth, he
writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April
and May. He will carry ’t, he will carry ’t. ’Tis in his
buttons he will carry ’t.
Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman
is of no having. He kept company with the
wild Prince and Poins. He is of too high a region;
he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in
his fortunes with the finger of my substance. If he
take her, let him take her simply. The wealth I have
waits on my consent, and my consent goes not that
way.
I beseech you heartily, some of you go home
with me to dinner. Besides your cheer, you shall
have sport: I will show you a monster. Master Doctor,
you shall go.—So shall you, Master Page.—
And you, Sir Hugh.
Well, fare you well. We shall have the freer
wooing at Master Page’s.
Go home, John Rugby. I come anon.
Farewell, my hearts. I will to my honest knight
Falstaff, and drink canary with him.
I think I shall drink in pipe-wine first
with him; I’ll make him dance.—Will you go,
gentles?
Have with you to
see this monster.
What, John! What, Robert!
Quickly, quickly! Is the buck-basket—
I warrant.—What, Robert, I say!
Come, come, come.
Here, set it down.
Give your men the charge. We must be
brief.
Marry, as I told you before, John and
Robert, be ready here hard by in the brewhouse,
and when I suddenly call you, come forth, and
without any pause or staggering take this basket
on your shoulders. That done, trudge with it in all
haste, and carry it among the whitsters in Datchet
Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch close
by the Thames side.
You will do it?
I ha’ told them over and over. They lack
no direction.—Be gone, and come when you are
called.
Here comes little Robin.
How now, my eyas-musket? What news
with you?
My master, Sir John, is come in at your back
door, Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been
true to us?
Ay, I’ll be sworn. My master knows not of your
being here and hath threatened to put me into
everlasting liberty if I tell you of it, for he swears
he’ll turn me away.
Thou ’rt a good boy. This secrecy of
thine shall be a tailor to thee and shall make thee a
new doublet and hose.—I’ll go hide me.
Do so.—Go tell thy master I am alone.
Mistress Page, remember you your
cue.
I warrant thee. If I do not act it, hiss
me.
Go to, then. We’ll use this unwholesome
humidity, this gross-wat’ry pumpion. We’ll
teach him to know turtles from jays.
Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?
Why, now let me die, for I have lived long enough.
This is the period of my ambition. O, this blessèd
hour!
O, sweet Sir John!
Mistress Ford, I cannot cog. I cannot prate,
Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
thy husband were dead. I’ll speak it before the best
lord: I would make thee my lady.
I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be
a pitiful lady.
Let the court of France show me such
another. I see how thine eye would emulate the
diamond. Thou hast the right arched beauty of the
brow that becomes the ship-tire, the tire-valiant,
or any tire of Venetian admittance.
A plain kerchief, Sir John. My brows
become nothing else, nor that well neither.
Thou art a tyrant to say so. Thou wouldst
make an absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of
thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait
in a semicircled farthingale. I see what thou wert,
if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature thy friend.
Come, thou canst not hide it.
Believe me, there’s no such thing in
me.
What made me love thee? Let that persuade
thee. There’s something extraordinary in thee.
Come, I cannot cog and say thou art this and that
like a many of these lisping hawthorn buds that
come like women in men’s apparel and smell like
Bucklersbury in simple time. I cannot. But I love
thee, none but thee; and thou deserv’st it.
Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love
Mistress Page.
Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by
the Counter gate, which is as hateful to me as the
reek of a lime-kiln.
Well, heaven knows how I love you,
and you shall one day find it.
Keep in that mind. I’ll deserve it.
Nay, I must tell you, so you do, or else
I could not be in that mind.
Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! Here’s Mistress
Page at the door, sweating and blowing and looking
wildly, and would needs speak with you
presently.
She shall not see me. I will ensconce me behind
the arras.
Pray you, do so. She’s a very tattling
woman.
What’s the matter? How now?
O Mistress Ford, what have you done?
You’re shamed, you’re overthrown, you’re undone
forever!
What’s the matter, good Mistress Page?
O well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an
honest man to your husband, to give him such
cause of suspicion!
What cause of suspicion?
What cause of suspicion? Out upon you!
How am I mistook in you!
Why, alas, what’s the matter?
Your husband’s coming hither, woman,
with all the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman
that he says is here now in the house, by
your consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence.
You are undone.
’Tis not so, I hope.
Pray heaven it be not so, that you have
such a man here! But ’tis most certain your husband’s
coming, with half Windsor at his heels, to
search for such a one. I come before to tell you. If
you know yourself clear, why, I am glad of it. But if
you have a friend here, convey, convey him out. Be
not amazed! Call all your senses to you; defend
your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life
forever.
What shall I do? There is a gentleman,
my dear friend; and I fear not mine own shame so
much as his peril. I had rather than a thousand
pound he were out of the house.
For shame! Never stand you had
rather and you had rather. Your husband’s here
at hand. Bethink you of some conveyance. In the
house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived
me! Look, here is a basket. If he be of any
reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and
throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to
bucking. Or—it is whiting time—send him by your
two men to Datchet Mead.
He’s too big to go in there. What shall I
do?
Let me see ’t, let me see ’t! O, let me see ’t! I’ll
in, I’ll in. Follow your friend’s counsel. I’ll in.
What, Sir John Falstaff?
Are these your letters, knight?
I love thee. Help me
away. Let me creep in here. I’ll never—
Help to cover your master,
boy.—Call your men, Mistress Ford.—You dissembling
knight!
What, John! Robert! John!
Go, take up these clothes here quickly. Where’s the
cowlstaff? Look how you drumble! Carry them to
the laundress in Datchet Mead. Quickly! Come.
Pray you, come near. If I suspect without cause,
why then make sport at me. Then let me be your
jest; I deserve it.—How now? Whither bear you
this?
To the laundress, forsooth.
Why, what have you to do whither they
bear it? You were best meddle with buck-washing!
Buck? I would I could wash myself of the buck.
Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck! I warrant you, buck,
and of the season too, it shall appear.
Gentlemen, I have dreamed tonight; I’ll tell you my
dream. Here, here, here be my keys. Ascend my
chambers. Search, seek, find out. I’ll warrant we’ll
unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.
So, now uncape.
Good Master Ford, be contented. You wrong
yourself too much.
True, Master Page.—Up, gentlemen. You shall
see sport anon. Follow me, gentlemen.
This is fery fantastical humors and
jealousies.
By gar, ’tis no the fashion of France. It is
not jealous in France.
Nay, follow him, gentlemen. See the issue of his
search.
Is there not a double excellency in this?
I know not which pleases me better—
that my husband is deceived, or Sir John.
What a taking was he in when your
husband asked who was in the basket!
I am half afraid he will have need of
washing, so throwing him into the water will do
him a benefit.
Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all
of the same strain were in the same distress.
I think my husband hath some special
suspicion of Falstaff’s being here, for I never saw
him so gross in his jealousy till now.
I will lay a plot to try that, and we will
yet have more tricks with Falstaff. His dissolute
disease will scarce obey this medicine.
Shall we send that foolish carrion Mistress
Quickly to him, and excuse his throwing into
the water, and give him another hope, to betray
him to another punishment?
We will do it. Let him be sent for tomorrow
eight o’clock to have amends.
I cannot find him. Maybe the knave bragged of
that he could not compass.
Heard you
that?
You use me well, Master Ford, do you?
Ay, I do so.
Heaven make you better than your
thoughts!
Amen!
You do yourself mighty wrong, Master
Ford.
Ay, ay. I must bear it.
If there be anypody in the house, and in the
chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,
heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!
Be gar, nor I too. There is nobodies.
Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not ashamed?
What spirit, what devil suggests this imagination?
I would not ha’ your distemper in this kind for the
wealth of Windsor Castle.
’Tis my fault, Master Page. I suffer for it.
You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is
as honest a ’omans as I will desires among five
thousand, and five hundred too.
By gar, I see ’tis an honest woman.
Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come,
walk in the park. I pray you, pardon me. I will
hereafter make known to you why I have done
this.—Come, wife—come, Mistress Page, I pray
you, pardon me. Pray, heartily, pardon me.
Let’s go in, gentlemen.
But, trust me, we’ll mock him.
I do invite you tomorrow morning
to my house to breakfast. After, we’ll a-birding together;
I have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be
so?
Anything.
If there is one, I shall make two in the
company.
If there be one or two, I shall make-a the
turd.
Pray you, go, Master Page.
I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on
the lousy knave mine Host.
Dat is good, by gar, with all my heart.
A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his
mockeries!
I see I cannot get thy father’s love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
Alas, how then?
Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object I am too great of birth,
And that, my state being galled with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth.
Besides these, other bars he lays before me—
My riots past, my wild societies—
And tells me ’tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.
Maybe he tells you true.
No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father’s wealth
Was the first motive that I wooed thee, Anne,
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealèd bags.
And ’tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.
Gentle Master Fenton,
Yet seek my father’s love, still seek it, sir.
If opportunity and humblest suit
Cannot attain it, why then—hark you hither.
Break their talk, Mistress Quickly. My kinsman
shall speak for himself.
I’ll make a shaft or a bolt on ’t. ’Slid, ’tis but
venturing.
Be not dismayed.
No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for
that, but that I am afeard.
Hark ye, Master Slender
would speak a word with you.
I come to him. This is my father’s choice.
O, what a world of vile ill-favored faults
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!
And how does good Master Fenton?
Pray you, a word with you.
She’s coming. To her, coz! O
boy, thou hadst a father!
I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can
tell you good jests of him.—Pray you, uncle, tell
Mistress Anne the jest how my father stole two
geese out of a pen, good uncle.
Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.
Ay, that I do, as well as I love any woman in
Gloucestershire.
He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
Ay, that I will, come cut and longtail, under
the degree of a squire.
He will make you a hundred and fifty
pounds jointure.
Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.
Marry, I thank you for it. I thank you for that
good comfort.—She calls you, coz. I’ll leave you.
Now, Master Slender.
Now, good Mistress Anne.
What is your will?
My will? ’Od’s heartlings, that’s a pretty jest
indeed! I ne’er made my will yet, I thank heaven. I
am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.
I mean, Master Slender, what would you with
me?
Truly, for mine own part, I would little or
nothing with you. Your father and my uncle hath
made motions. If it be my luck, so; if not, happy
man be his dole. They can tell you how things go
better than I can. You may ask your father.
Here he comes.
Now, Master Slender.—Love him, daughter Anne.—
Why, how now? What does Master Fenton here?
You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house.
I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.
Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.
Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
She is no match for you.
Sir, will you hear me?
No, good Master Fenton.—
Come Master Shallow.—Come, son Slender, in.—
Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
Speak to Mistress Page.
Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,
I must advance the colors of my love
And not retire. Let me have your good will.
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.
That’s my master, Master Doctor.
Alas, I had rather be set quick i’ th’ earth
And bowled to death with turnips!
Come, trouble not yourself.—Good Master Fenton,
I will not be your friend nor enemy.
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
And as I find her, so am I affected.
Till then, farewell, sir. She must needs go in;
Her father will be angry.
Farewell, gentle mistress.—Farewell, Nan.
This is my doing now. Nay, said I,
will you cast away your child on a fool and a
physician? Look on Master Fenton. This is my
doing.
I thank thee; and I pray thee, once tonight
Give my sweet Nan this ring. There’s for thy pains.
Now heaven send thee good fortune.
A kind heart he hath. A woman would run through
fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
would my master had Mistress Anne, or I would
Master Slender had her, or, in sooth, I would Master
Fenton had her. I will do what I can for them all
three; for so I have promised and I’ll be as good as
my word—but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
my two mistresses. What a beast am I to slack it!
Bardolph, I say!
Here, sir.
Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in ’t.
Have I lived to be carried in a basket like a barrow
of butcher’s offal, and to be thrown in the Thames?
Well, if I be served such another trick, I’ll have my
brains ta’en out and buttered, and give them to a
dog for a New Year’s gift. ’Sblood, the rogues
slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
they would have drowned a blind bitch’s puppies,
fifteen i’ th’ litter! And you may know by my size
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the bottom
were as deep as hell, I should down. I had
been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and
shallow—a death that I abhor, for the water swells
a man, and what a thing should I have been when
I had been swelled! By the Lord, I should have
been a mountain of mummy.
Here’s Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with
you.
Come, let me pour in some sack to the
Thames water, for my belly’s as cold as if I had
swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins.
Call her in.
Come in, woman.
By your leave, I cry you mercy. Give
your Worship good morrow.
Take away these chalices. Go
brew me a pottle of sack finely.
With eggs, sir?
Simple of itself. I’ll no pullet sperm in my
brewage.
How now?
Marry, sir, I come to your Worship
from Mistress Ford.
Mistress Ford? I have had ford enough. I
was thrown into the ford, I have my belly full of
ford.
Alas the day, good heart, that was
not her fault. She does so take on with her men;
they mistook their erection.
So did I mine, to build upon a foolish
woman’s promise.
Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it
would yearn your heart to see it. Her husband goes
this morning a-birding; she desires you once more
to come to her, between eight and nine. I must
carry her word quickly. She’ll make you amends, I
warrant you.
Well, I will visit her. Tell her so. And bid her
think what a man is. Let her consider his frailty,
and then judge of my merit.
I will tell her.
Do so. Between nine and ten, say’st thou?
Eight and nine, sir.
Well, be gone. I will not miss her.
Peace be with you, sir.
I marvel I hear not of Master Brook. He
sent me word to stay within. I like his money well.
O, here he comes.
God bless you, sir.
Now, Master Brook, you come to know
what hath passed between me and Ford’s wife.
That indeed, Sir John, is my
business.
Master Brook, I will not lie to you. I was at
her house the hour she appointed me.
And sped you, sir?
Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
How so, sir? Did she change her
determination?
No, Master Brook, but the peaking cornuto
her husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
’larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of
our encounter, after we had embraced, kissed,
protested, and, as it were, spoke the prologue of
our comedy, and, at his heels, a rabble of his companions,
thither provoked and instigated by his
distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for
his wife’s love.
What, while you were there?
While I was there.
And did he search for you and could
not find you?
You shall hear. As good luck would have it,
comes in one Mistress Page, gives intelligence of
Ford’s approach, and, in her invention and Ford’s
wife’s distraction, they conveyed me into a
buck-basket.
A buck-basket!
By the Lord, a buck-basket! Rammed me
in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings,
greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there
was the rankest compound of villainous smell that
ever offended nostril.
And how long lay you there?
Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I
have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your
good. Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple
of Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were called forth by
their mistress to carry me in the name of foul
clothes to Datchet Lane. They took me on their
shoulders, met the jealous knave their master in
the door, who asked them once or twice what they
had in their basket. I quaked for fear lest the lunatic
knave would have searched it, but fate, ordaining
he should be a cuckold, held his hand.
Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for
foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook.
I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first,
an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous
rotten bellwether; next, to be compassed, like a
good bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in, like
a strong distillation, with stinking clothes that fretted
in their own grease. Think of that, a man of my
kidney—think of that—that am as subject to heat
as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw.
It was a miracle to ’scape suffocation. And in
the height of this bath, when I was more than half-stewed
in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be thrown
into the Thames and cooled, glowing hot, in that
surge, like a horseshoe! Think of that—hissing
hot—think of that, Master Brook.
In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that
for my sake you have suffered all this. My suit,
then, is desperate. You’ll undertake her no more?
Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna,
as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her
thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding.
I have received from her another embassy of meeting.
’Twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master
Brook.
’Tis past eight already, sir.
Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
Come to me at your convenient leisure,
and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion
shall be crowned with your enjoying her.
Adieu. You shall have her, Master Brook. Master
Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.
Hum! Ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I
sleep? Master Ford, awake! Awake, Master Ford!
There’s a hole made in your best coat, Master
Ford. This ’tis to be married; this ’tis to have linen
and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
what I am. I will now take the lecher. He is at my
house. He cannot ’scape me. ’Tis impossible he
should. He cannot creep into a half-penny purse,
nor into a pepper-box. But lest the devil that
guides him should aid him, I will search impossible
places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to
be what I would not shall not make me tame. If I
have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
with me: I’ll be horn-mad.
Is he at Master Ford’s already, think’st
thou?
Sure he is by this, or will be presently.
But truly he is very courageous mad about
his throwing into the water. Mistress Ford desires
you to come suddenly.
I’ll be with her by and by. I’ll but bring
my young man here to school.
Look where his master comes. ’Tis a playing day, I
see.—How now, Sir Hugh, no school today?
No. Master Slender is let the boys leave to
play.
Blessing of his heart!
Sir Hugh, my husband says my son
profits nothing in the world at his book. I pray you,
ask him some questions in his accidence.
Come hither, William. Hold up your head.
Come.
Come on, sirrah. Hold up your head.
Answer your master. Be not afraid.
William, how many numbers is in nouns?
Two.
Truly, I thought there had been one
number more, because they say ’Od’s nouns.
Peace your tattlings!—What is fair,
William?
Pulcher.
Polecats? There are fairer things
than polecats, sure.
You are a very simplicity ’oman. I pray you,
peace.—What is lapis, William?
A stone.
And what is a stone, William?
A pebble.
No. It is lapis. I pray you, remember in your
prain.
Lapis.
That is a good William. What is he, William,
that does lend articles?
Articles are borrowed of the pronoun and be
thus declined: singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec,
hoc.
Nominativo, hig, haeg, hog. Pray you, mark:
genitivo, huius. Well, what is your accusative case?
Accusativo, hinc.
I pray you, have your remembrance, child.
Accusativo, hung, hang, hog.
Hang-hog is Latin for bacon, I
warrant you.
Leave your prabbles, ’oman.—What is the
focative case, William?
O—vocativo—O—
Remember, William, focative is caret.
And that’s a good root.
’Oman, forbear.
Peace!
What is your genitive case plural, William?
Genitive case?
Ay.
Genitive: horum, harum, horum.
Vengeance of Ginny’s case! Fie on
her! Never name her, child, if she be a whore.
For shame, ’oman!
You do ill to teach the child such
words.—He teaches him to hick and to hack,
which they’ll do fast enough of themselves, and to
call whorum.—Fie upon you!
’Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings
for thy cases and the numbers of the
genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as
I would desires.
Prithee, hold thy
peace.
Show me now, William, some declensions of
your pronouns.
Forsooth, I have forgot.
It is qui, quae, quod. If you forget your qui’s,
your quae’s, and your quod’s, you must be
preeches. Go your ways and play, go.
He is a better scholar than I thought he
was.
He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress
Page.
Adieu, good Sir Hugh.—Get you home,
boy. Come. We stay too
long.
Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up
my sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your
love, and I profess requital to a hair’s breadth, not
only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love,
but in all the accoutrement, compliment, and ceremony
of it. But are you sure of your husband now?
He’s a-birding, sweet Sir John.
What ho, gossip Ford! What
ho!
Step into th’ chamber, Sir John.
How now, sweetheart, who’s at home
besides yourself?
Why, none but mine own people.
Indeed?
No, certainly. Speak
louder.
Truly, I am so glad you have nobody
here.
Why?
Why, woman, your husband is in his
old lunes again. He so takes on yonder with my
husband, so rails against all married mankind, so
curses all Eve’s daughters of what complexion soever,
and so buffets himself on the forehead, crying
Peer out, peer out! that any madness I ever yet
beheld seemed but tameness, civility, and patience
to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat
knight is not here.
Why, does he talk of him?
Of none but him, and swears he was
carried out, the last time he searched for him, in a
basket; protests to my husband he is now here;
and hath drawn him and the rest of their company
from their sport to make another experiment of
his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not here.
Now he shall see his own foolery.
How near is he, Mistress Page?
Hard by, at street end. He will be here
anon.
I am undone! The knight is here.
Why then, you are utterly shamed, and
he’s but a dead man. What a woman are you! Away
with him, away with him! Better shame than
murder.
Which way should he go? How should
I bestow him? Shall I put him into the basket
again?
No, I’ll come no more i’ th’ basket. May I not
go out ere he come?
Alas, three of Master Ford’s brothers
watch the door with pistols, that none shall issue
out. Otherwise you might slip away ere he came.
But what make you here?
What shall I do? I’ll creep up into the
chimney.
There they always use to discharge
their birding pieces.
Creep into the kiln-hole.
Where is it?
He will seek there, on my word. Neither
press, coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he
hath an abstract for the remembrance of such
places, and goes to them by his note. There is no
hiding you in the house.
I’ll go out, then.
If you go out in your own semblance,
you die, Sir John—unless you go out disguised.
How might we disguise him?
Alas the day, I know not. There is no
woman’s gown big enough for him; otherwise he
might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and
so escape.
Good hearts, devise something. Any extremity
rather than a mischief.
My maid’s aunt, the fat woman of
Brentford, has a gown above.
On my word, it will serve him. She’s as
big as he is. And there’s her thrummed hat and her
muffler too.—Run up, Sir John.
Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page
and I will look some linen for your head.
Quick, quick! We’ll come dress you
straight. Put on the gown the while.
I would my husband would meet him
in this shape. He cannot abide the old woman of
Brentford. He swears she’s a witch, forbade her my
house, and hath threatened to beat her.
Heaven guide him to thy husband’s
cudgel, and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards!
But is my husband coming?
Ay, in good sadness is he, and talks of
the basket too, howsoever he hath had
intelligence.
We’ll try that; for I’ll appoint my men
to carry the basket again, to meet him at the door
with it as they did last time.
Nay, but he’ll be here presently. Let’s go
dress him like the witch of Brentford.
I’ll first direct my men what they shall
do with the basket. Go up. I’ll bring linen for him
straight.
Hang him, dishonest varlet! We cannot
misuse him enough.
We’ll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
Wives may be merry and yet honest too.
We do not act that often jest and laugh;
’Tis old but true: Still swine eats all the draff.
Go, sirs, take the basket again on your
shoulders. Your master is hard at door. If he bid
you set it down, obey him. Quickly, dispatch.
Come, come, take it up.
Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.
I hope not. I had lief as bear so much lead.
Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you
any way then to unfool me again?—Set down the
basket, villain. Somebody
call my wife. Youth in a basket! O, you panderly
rascals! There’s a knot, a gang, a pack, a
conspiracy against me. Now shall the devil be
shamed.—What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!
Behold what honest clothes you send forth to
bleaching!
Why, this passes, Master Ford! You are not to go
loose any longer; you must be pinioned.
Why, this is lunatics. This is mad as a mad
dog.
Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.
So say I too, sir.
Come hither, Mistress Ford.—Mistress Ford, the
honest woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature,
that hath the jealous fool to her husband!—I
suspect without cause, mistress, do I?
Heaven be my witness you do, if you
suspect me in any dishonesty.
Well said, brazen-face. Hold it out.—Come
forth, sirrah.
This passes.
Are you not ashamed? Let the clothes
alone.
I shall find you anon.
’Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your
wife’s clothes? Come, away.
Empty the basket, I say.
Why, man, why?
Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed
out of my house yesterday in this basket.
Why may not he be there again? In my house I am
sure he is. My intelligence is true, my jealousy is
reasonable.—Pluck me out all the linen.
If you find a man there, he shall die a
flea’s death.
Here’s no man.
By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford.
This wrongs you.
Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow
the imaginations of your own heart. This is
jealousies.
Well, he’s not here I seek for.
No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.
Help to search my house this one time. If I find
not what I seek, show no color for my extremity.
Let me forever be your table-sport. Let them say of
me As jealous as Ford, that searched a hollow
walnut for his wife’s leman. Satisfy me once
more. Once more search with me.
What ho, Mistress
Page! Come you and the old woman down. My
husband will come into the chamber.
Old woman? What old woman’s that?
Why, it is my maid’s aunt of Brentford.
A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have
I not forbid her my house? She comes of errands,
does she? We are simple men; we do not know
what’s brought to pass under the profession of
fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells, by
th’ figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond our
element. We know nothing.— Come down, you
witch, you hag, you! Come down, I say!
Nay, good sweet husband!—Good gentlemen,
let him not strike the old woman.
Come, Mother Pratt; come, give me
your hand.
I’ll pratt her. Out of my
door, you witch, you rag, you baggage, you polecat,
you runnion! Out, out! I’ll conjure you, I’ll
fortune-tell you!
Are you not ashamed? I think you have
killed the poor woman.
Nay, he will do it.—’Tis a goodly credit
for you.
Hang her, witch!
By yea and no, I think the ’oman is a witch
indeed. I like not when a ’oman has a great peard.
I spy a great peard under her muffler.
Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow.
See but the issue of my jealousy. If I cry out
thus upon no trail, never trust me when I open
again.
Let’s obey his humor a little further. Come,
gentlemen.
Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.
Nay, by th’ Mass, that he did not; he
beat him most unpitifully, methought.
I’ll have the cudgel hallowed and hung
o’er the altar. It hath done meritorious service.
What think you? May we, with the
warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good
conscience, pursue him with any further revenge?
The spirit of wantonness is, sure,
scared out of him. If the devil have him not in fee
simple, with fine and recovery, he will never, I
think, in the way of waste, attempt us again.
Shall we tell our husbands how we
have served him?
Yes, by all means—if it be but to scrape
the figures out of your husband’s brains. If they
can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat
knight shall be any further afflicted, we two will
still be the ministers.
I’ll warrant they’ll have him publicly
shamed, and methinks there would be no period to
the jest should he not be publicly shamed.
Come, to the forge with it, then shape
it. I would not have things cool.
Sir, the Germans desire to have three of
your horses. The Duke himself will be tomorrow at
court, and they are going to meet him.
What duke should that be comes so secretly? I
hear not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
gentlemen. They speak English?
Ay, sir. I’ll call them to you.
They shall have my horses, but I’ll make them
pay. I’ll sauce them. They have had my house a
week at command; I have turned away my other
guests. They must come off. I’ll sauce them. Come.
’Tis one of the best discretions of a ’oman as
ever I did look upon.
And did he send you both these letters at an
instant?
Within a quarter of an hour.
Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt.
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
Than thee with wantonness. Now doth thy honor
stand,
In him that was of late an heretic,
As firm as faith.
’Tis well, ’tis well. No more.
Be not as extreme in submission as in offense.
But let our plot go forward. Let our wives
Yet once again, to make us public sport,
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.
There is no better way than that they spoke of.
How, to send him word they’ll meet him in the
park at midnight? Fie, fie, he’ll never come.
You say he has been thrown in the rivers
and has been grievously peaten as an old ’oman.
Methinks there should be terrors in him, that he
should not come. Methinks his flesh is punished;
he shall have no desires.
So think I too.
Devise but how you’ll use him when he comes,
And let us two devise to bring him thither.
There is an old tale goes that Herne the Hunter,
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest,
Doth all the wintertime, at still midnight,
Walk round about an oak, with great ragged horns,
And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,
And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a
chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner.
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the Hunter for a truth.
Why, yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Herne’s oak.
But what of this?
Marry, this is our device,
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.
Well, let it not be doubted but he’ll come.
And in this shape when you have brought him
thither,
What shall be done with him? What is your plot?
That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
Nan Page my daughter, and my little son,
And three or four more of their growth we’ll dress
Like urchins, aufs, and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads
And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she, and I are newly met,
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffusèd song. Upon their sight,
We two in great amazedness will fly.
Then let them all encircle him about,
And, fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight,
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.
And till he tell the truth,
Let the supposèd fairies pinch him sound
And burn him with their tapers.
The truth being known,
We’ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
And mock him home to Windsor.
The children must
Be practiced well to this, or they’ll ne’er do ’t.
I will teach the children their behaviors, and
I will be like a jackanapes also, to burn the knight
with my taber.
That will be excellent. I’ll go buy them vizards.
My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
Finely attirèd in a robe of white.
That silk will I go buy. And in that time
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
And marry her at Eton.—Go, send to Falstaff
straight.
Nay, I’ll to him again in name of Brook.
He’ll tell me all his purpose. Sure he’ll come.
Fear not you that. Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies.
Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures and
fery honest knaveries.
Go, Mistress Ford,
Send quickly to Sir John to know his mind.
I’ll to the doctor. He hath my good will,
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
That Slender, though well-landed, is an idiot,
And he my husband best of all affects.
The doctor is well-moneyed, and his friends
Potent at court. He, none but he, shall have her,
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.
What wouldst thou have, boor? What, thickskin?
Speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick,
snap.
Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
from Master Slender.
There’s his chamber, his house, his castle, his
standing-bed and truckle-bed. ’Tis painted about
with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go,
knock and call. He’ll speak like an Anthropophaginian
unto thee. Knock, I say.
There’s an old woman, a fat woman, gone up
into his chamber. I’ll be so bold as stay, sir, till she
come down. I come to speak with her, indeed.
Ha? A fat woman? The knight may be robbed.
I’ll call.—Bully knight! Bully Sir John! Speak from
thy lungs military. Art thou there? It is thine Host,
thine Ephesian, calls.
How now, mine Host?
Here’s a Bohemian Tartar tarries the coming
down of thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let
her descend. My chambers are honorable. Fie! Privacy?
Fie!
There was, mine Host, an old fat woman
even now with me, but she’s gone.
Pray you, sir, was ’t not the wise woman of
Brentford?
Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell. What would
you with her?
My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her,
seeing her go through the streets, to know, sir,
whether one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain,
had the chain or no.
I spake with the old woman about it.
And what says she, I pray, sir?
Marry, she says that the very same man that
beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him
of it.
I would I could have spoken with the woman
herself. I had other things to have spoken with her
too from him.
What are they? Let us know.
Ay, come. Quick!
I may not conceal them, sir.
Conceal them, or thou diest.
Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress
Anne Page, to know if it were my master’s fortune
to have her or no.
’Tis; ’tis his fortune.
What, sir?
To have her or no. Go. Say the woman told
me so.
May I be bold to say so, sir?
Ay, sir; like who more bold.
I thank your Worship. I shall make my master
glad with these tidings.
Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was
there a wise woman with thee?
Ay, that there was, mine Host, one that hath
taught me more wit than ever I learned before in
my life. And I paid nothing for it neither, but was
paid for my learning.
Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere
cozenage!
Where be my horses? Speak well of them,
varletto.
Run away with the cozeners. For so soon as
I came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind
one of them in a slough of mire, and set
spurs, and away, like three German devils, three
Doctor Faustuses.
They are gone but to meet the Duke, villain. Do
not say they be fled. Germans are honest men.
Where is mine Host?
What is the matter, sir?
Have a care of your entertainments. There is
a friend of mine come to town tells me there is
three cozen-Germans that has cozened all the
hosts of Readings, of Maidenhead, of Colnbrook,
of horses and money. I tell you for good will, look
you. You are wise, and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks,
and ’tis not convenient you should be cozened.
Fare you well.
Vere is mine Host de Jarteer?
Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful
dilemma.
I cannot tell vat is dat. But it is tell-a me
dat you make grand preparation for a duke de
Jamanie. By my trot, dere is no duke that the court
is know to come. I tell you for good will. Adieu.
Hue and cry, villain, go!—Assist
me, knight. I am undone.—Fly, run; hue and cry,
villain! I am undone.
I would all the world might be cozened, for I
have been cozened and beaten too. If it should
come to the ear of the court how I have been transformed,
and how my transformation hath been
washed and cudgeled, they would melt me out of
my fat drop by drop, and liquor fishermen’s boots
with me. I warrant they would whip me with their
fine wits till I were as crestfallen as a dried pear. I
never prospered since I forswore myself at
primero. Well, if my wind were but long enough, I
would repent.
Now, whence come you?
From the two parties, forsooth.
The devil take one party, and his dam the
other, and so they shall be both bestowed. I have
suffered more for their sakes, more than the villainous
inconstancy of man’s disposition is able to
bear.
And have not they suffered? Yes, I
warrant, speciously one of them. Mistress Ford,
good heart, is beaten black and blue that you cannot
see a white spot about her.
What tell’st thou me of black and blue? I was
beaten myself into all the colors of the rainbow,
and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
Brentford. But that my admirable dexterity of wit,
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman, delivered
me, the knave constable had set me i’ th’
stocks, i’ th’ common stocks, for a witch.
Sir, let me speak with you in your
chamber. You shall hear how things go, and, I warrant,
to your content. Here is a letter will say
somewhat. Good hearts,
what ado here is to bring you together! Sure, one
of you does not serve heaven well, that you are so
crossed.
Come up into my chamber.
Master Fenton, talk not to me. My mind is
heavy. I will give over all.
Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
And, as I am a gentleman, I’ll give thee
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
I will hear you, Master Fenton, and I will, at the
least, keep your counsel.
From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page,
Who mutually hath answered my affection,
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
Even to my wish. I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at,
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter
That neither singly can be manifested
Without the show of both. Fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene; the image of the jest
I’ll show you here at large.
Hark, good mine Host:
Tonight at Herne’s oak, just ’twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen—
The purpose why is here—in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender, and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry. She hath consented. Now, sir,
Her mother, ever strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
And at the dean’ry, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her. To this her mother’s plot
She, seemingly obedient, likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white,
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him. Her mother hath intended
The better to denote her to the doctor—
For they must all be masked and vizarded—
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
With ribbons pendent flaring ’bout her head;
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand, and on that token
The maid hath given consent to go with him.
Which means she to deceive, father or mother?
Both, my good Host, to go along with me.
And here it rests, that you’ll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church ’twixt twelve and one,
And, in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.
Well, husband your device. I’ll to the vicar.
Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.
So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
Besides, I’ll make a present recompense.
Prithee, no more prattling. Go. I’ll hold. This
is the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd numbers.
Away, go. They say there is divinity in odd
numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death.
Away.
I’ll provide you a chain, and I’ll do
what I can to get you a pair of horns.
Away, I say! Time wears. Hold up your head,
and mince.
How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the
matter will be known tonight or never. Be you in
the park about midnight, at Herne’s oak, and you
shall see wonders.
Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as
you told me you had appointed?
I went to her, Master Brook, as you see,
like a poor old man, but I came from her, Master
Brook, like a poor old woman. That same knave
Ford, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of
jealousy in him, Master Brook, that ever governed
frenzy. I will tell you, he beat me grievously,
in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man,
Master Brook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver’s
beam, because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in
haste. Go along with me; I’ll tell you all, Master
Brook. Since I plucked geese, played truant, and
whipped top, I knew not what ’twas to be beaten
till lately. Follow me. I’ll tell you strange things of
this knave Ford, on whom tonight I will be revenged,
and I will deliver his wife into your hand.
Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook!
Follow.
Come, come. We’ll couch i’ th’ castle ditch till we
see the light of our fairies.—Remember, son Slender,
my—
Ay, forsooth, I have spoke with her, and we
have a nayword how to know one another. I come
to her in white and cry mum, she cries budget,
and by that we know one another.
That’s good too. But what needs either your
mum or her budget? The white will decipher
her well enough. It hath struck ten o’clock.
The night is dark. Light and spirits will become
it well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means
evil but the devil, and we shall know him by his
horns. Let’s away. Follow me.
Master Doctor, my daughter is in
green. When you see your time, take her by the
hand; away with her to the deanery, and dispatch
it quickly. Go before into the park. We two must go
together.
I know vat I have to do. Adieu.
Fare you well, sir.
My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse
of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor’s marrying
my daughter. But ’tis no matter. Better a little chiding
than a great deal of heartbreak.
Where is Nan now, and her troop of
fairies, and the Welsh devil Hugh?
They are all couched in a pit hard by
Herne’s oak, with obscured lights, which, at the
very instant of Falstaff’s and our meeting, they will
at once display to the night.
That cannot choose but amaze him.
If he be not amazed, he will be
mocked. If he be amazed, he will every way be
mocked.
We’ll betray him finely.
Against such lewdsters and their lechery,
Those that betray them do no treachery.
The hour draws on. To the oak, to the
oak!
Trib, trib, fairies! Come, and remember
your parts. Be pold, I pray you. Follow me into the
pit, and when I give the watch-’ords, do as I pid
you. Come, come; trib, trib.
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve. The
minute draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist
me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy
Europa; love set on thy horns. O powerful love,
that in some respects makes a beast a man, in
some other a man a beast! You were also, Jupiter,
a swan for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love,
how near the god drew to the complexion of a
goose! A fault done first in the form of a beast; O
Jove, a beastly fault! And then another fault in the
semblance of a fowl; think on ’t, Jove, a foul fault.
When gods have hot backs, what shall poor men
do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag, and the fattest,
I think, i’ th’ forest. Send me a cool rut-time,
Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow?
Who comes here? My doe?
Sir John? Art thou there, my deer, my
male deer?
My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
potatoes, let it thunder to the tune of Greensleeves,
hail kissing-comfits, and snow eryngoes; let there
come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me
here.
Mistress Page is come with me,
sweetheart.
Divide me like a bribed buck, each a haunch.
I will keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for
the fellow of this walk, and my horns I bequeath
your husbands. Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like
Herne the Hunter? Why, now is Cupid a child of
conscience; he makes restitution. As I am a true
spirit, welcome.
Alas, what noise?
Heaven forgive our sins!
What should this be?
Away, away.
I think the devil will not have me damned,
lest the oil that’s in me should set hell on fire. He
would never else cross me thus.
Fairies black, gray, green, and white,
You moonshine revelers and shades of night,
You orphan heirs of fixèd destiny,
Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.
Elves, list your names. Silence, you airy toys!—
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap,
Where fires thou find’st unraked and hearths
unswept.
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry.
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.
They are fairies. He that speaks to them shall die.
I’ll wink and couch. No man their works must eye.
Where’s Bead? Go you, and where you find a maid
That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said,
Raise up the organs of her fantasy;
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy.
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and
shins.
About, about!
Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out.
Strew good luck, aufs, on every sacred room,
That it may stand till the perpetual doom
In state as wholesome as in state ’tis fit,
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower.
Each fair installment, coat, and sev’ral crest
With loyal blazon evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow fairies, look you sing,
Like to the Garter’s compass, in a ring.
Th’ expressure that it bears, green let it be,
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
And Honi soit qui mal y pense write
In em’rald tufts, flowers purple, blue, and white,
Like sapphire, pearl, and rich embroidery,
Buckled below fair knighthood’s bending knee.
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
Away, disperse! But till ’tis one o’clock,
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the Hunter let us not forget.
Pray you, lock hand in hand. Yourselves in order set;
And twenty glowworms shall our lanterns be,
To guide our measure round about the tree.
But stay! I smell a man of Middle Earth.
Heavens defend me from that Welsh
fairy, lest he transform me to a piece of cheese.
Vile worm, thou wast o’erlooked even in thy birth.
With trial-fire touch me his finger-end.
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain. But if he start,
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.
A trial, come!
Come, will this wood take fire?
O, O, O!
Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
About him, fairies. Sing a scornful rhyme,
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
Fie on sinful fantasy!
Fie on lust and luxury!
Lust is but a bloody fire
Kindled with unchaste desire,
Fed in heart whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them higher and higher.
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
Pinch him for his villainy.
Pinch him and burn him and turn him about,
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.
Nay, do not fly. I think we have watched you now.
Will none but Herne the Hunter serve your turn?
I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.—
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
See you these, husband? Do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town?
Now, sir, who’s a cuckold now?
Master Brook, Falstaff’s a knave, a cuckoldly
knave. Here are his horns, Master Brook. And,
Master Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford’s
but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty
pounds of money, which must be paid to Master
Brook. His horses are arrested for it, Master
Brook.
Sir John, we have had ill luck. We
could never meet. I will never take you for my love
again, but I will always count you my deer.
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
Ay, and an ox too. Both the proofs are extant.
And these are not fairies. I was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet
the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of
my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into
a received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when ’tis upon
ill employment.
Sir John Falstaff, serve Got and leave your
desires, and fairies will not pinse you.
Well said, Fairy Hugh.
And leave you your jealousies too, I pray
you.
I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
able to woo her in good English.
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it,
that it wants matter to prevent so gross o’erreaching
as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too?
Shall I have a coxcomb of frieze? ’Tis time I were
choked with a piece of toasted cheese.
Seese is not good to give putter. Your belly is
all putter.
Seese and putter? Have I lived to stand at
the taunt of one that makes fritters of English?
This is enough to be the decay of lust and late
walking through the realm.
Why, Sir John, do you think though we
would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the
head and shoulders, and have given ourselves
without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could
have made you our delight?
What, a hodge-pudding? A bag of flax?
A puffed man?
Old, cold, withered, and of intolerable entrails?
And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
And as poor as Job?
And as wicked as his wife?
And given to fornications, and to taverns,
and sack, and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings
and swearings and starings, pribbles and
prabbles?
Well, I am your theme. You have the start of
me. I am dejected. I am not able to answer the
Welsh flannel. Ignorance itself is a plummet o’er
me. Use me as you will.
Marry, sir, we’ll bring you to Windsor to one
Master Brook, that you have cozened of money,
to whom you should have been a pander. Over and
above that you have suffered, I think to repay that
money will be a biting affliction.
Yet be cheerful, knight. Thou shalt eat a posset
tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to
laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her
Master Slender hath married her daughter.
Doctors doubt that. If Anne
Page be my daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius’
wife.
Whoa, ho, ho, Father Page!
Son, how now! How now, son! Have you
dispatched?
Dispatched? I’ll make the best in Gloucestershire
know on ’t. Would I were hanged, la, else!
Of what, son?
I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress
Anne Page, and she’s a great lubberly boy. If it had
not been i’ th’ church, I would have swinged him,
or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it
had been Anne Page, would I might never stir! And
’tis a post-master’s boy.
Upon my life, then, you took the wrong—
What need you tell me that? I think so, when
I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him,
for all he was in woman’s apparel, I would not
have had him.
Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you
how you should know my daughter by her
garments?
I went to her in white, and cried mum,
and she cried budget, as Anne and I had appointed,
and yet it was not Anne, but a post-master’s
boy.
Good George, be not angry. I knew of
your purpose, turned my daughter into green,
and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery,
and there married.
Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened!
I ha’ married un garçon, a boy; un paysan, by
gar, a boy. It is not Anne Page. By gar, I am
cozened.
Why? Did you take her in green?
Ay, be gar, and ’tis a boy. Be gar, I’ll raise
all Windsor.
This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?
My heart misgives me. Here comes Master Fenton.—
How now, Master Fenton!
Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.
Now, mistress, how chance you went not with
Master Slender?
Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?
You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
Th’ offense is holy that she hath committed,
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursèd hours
Which forcèd marriage would have brought upon her.
Stand not amazed. Here is no remedy.
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state.
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.
I am glad, though you have ta’en a special
stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath
glanced.
Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy.
What cannot be eschewed must be embraced.
When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.
Well, I will muse no further.—Master Fenton,
Heaven give you many, many merry days.—
Good husband, let us every one go home
And laugh this sport o’er by a country fire—
Sir John and all.
Let it be so, Sir John.
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word,
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
